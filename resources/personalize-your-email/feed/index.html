		<description><![CDATA[Brandon Landis Really good question.

I dove deep into this very issue here: http://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/personal-emails

A quick summary: 

The only reason to automate personal emails is because you’re sending something you would have typed and sent anyway. You should never automate a personal email without manually sending it first. When it gets to the point that you can’t keep up with the volume, considering automation. This is the best way to figure out what questions and copy actually drive responses.

We have found these to be a very effective too for learning but not necessarily selling. (More on results of our tests here: http://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/learning-vs-selling/)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jimmy, have you found putting the time into &#039;faking&#039; the one on one bespoke email to be effective in response and engagement rates?  I only ask because I remember listening to Gary Vaynerchuk a while back and one of the things that stuck was his advice on automation which was that it&#039;s ok to use, but don&#039;t try to fake it because people see through it.  That said, perhaps how many people know how autoresponders work or who care varies with your particular market?]]></description>
