		<description><![CDATA[Ethan - thanks!

I definitely agree with what you&#039;ve said here. I interpreted the study as suggesting that, despite the gains from the businesses perspective (i.e. being able to discount thanks to the high profit margin on the accessories), this can in fact turn consumers off.

Perhaps it&#039;d be better to run with no discount, or a small discount, on the camera! Either way it adds another data point to think about when it comes to customer behaviour :).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In general, a cool article.

However, be careful with your examples; there&#039;s more then one layer to most bundles.

For instance, in the camera bundle, the accessories essentially cost nothing (and have a huge margin), while the camera has a tiny margin.  Buy.com likely couldn&#039;t discount the camera, on it&#039;s own, more then a few %.  However, bundling with the accessories lets them claim a discount and sell a bunch of high-margin gear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Totally Steven - the idea is totally to challenge the notion of &#039;more is better&#039;. Just because you are technically throwing more in the bundle hardly means you are satisfying people&#039;s actual needs. As you point out, you might be actively deterring them!


Nice one :).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think a possibility (if I look specifically at the Lego bundle) is that I don&#039;t even want the added bonus. Chances are it isn&#039;t free either (even if you end up saving, you are paying for something you don&#039;t need). It is possible that the same thing happens with other bundles, sure I only pay X more for 20 more products, but why pay extra at all if I don&#039;t want/need any of the extras?]]></description>
