I totally agree: A clear objective is a must. (If you don&#039;t know what you want your customers to do, how are they supposed to know, right?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mccoy,


Thanks for letting us know about the header in #22! 


I&#039;ve been collecting marketing emails for the past year and half, so some of these emails might be over a year old. I also dumpster-dived into the Promotions folders of my friends and family too. You never know what treasures you find there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alexandra, 

FYI the headline formatting for #22  is not displaying correctly. 

Nice blog post, I like the way it is presented.  Am curious, how did you put the blog post together, did you collect these examples over the course of a few weeks?]]></description>
