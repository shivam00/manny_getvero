		<description><![CDATA[i would love that. if they like what they see it&#039;d be very interesting to run a test or hear the results of a made-over version! i am sure all of these fine experts would offer their help whenever possible but it might be hard to get us all in one room :).

		<description><![CDATA[Great, real world, practical suggestions.  They have probably already seen it, but just in case, I will make sure to send it to the HipChat team.  Awesome to see both the variation and the consistency in these answers.  Would you guys do this as a paid service if someone wanted their stuff reviewed?  Also, would you do a live panel at a Meetup with hundreds of distribution folks in the room?  Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great stuff.  Thanks for putting this together!

We implemented a bunch of these items as our saas product shares several similarities to HipChat.  Want to see how we did?  Just sign up for a GroupTweet account :).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this really great post.  I&#039;ve had a look at our welcome email and rewritten it.  We had a completely plain one - here are your log in details and a welcome one with a vague CTA.  I wasn&#039;t ever really happy with this situation, but this post has got me to do something about it! :-)]]></description>
