		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, timing is dependent on a number of factors but it&#039;s easy to miss those opportunities!

I agree that the Zoosk email is fairly ugly and a large proportion of their emails have one or two lines combined with MASSIVE amounts of blue, a big footer and a bunch of other &#039;junk&#039;. I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend their emails for inspiration - though it&#039;d be super interesting to see if / what they&#039;ve tested and how it&#039;s performed.

LinkedIn are doing a great job on their email at the moment. I love how they&#039;ve started experimenting with the message you get when someone adds you. E.g. http://drops.getvero.com/image/0F0t1i1a1v3E. It now says &quot;Good to find you on LinkedIn&quot; from &quot;Matthew Ho&quot;. It sounds much more personal...even though it&#039;s automated. Interesting stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great analysis and some useful insights. Not emailing customers enough - I think appropriate frequency is dependent on the business and customer. In the case of a dating website, you want to be informed if someone is looking at your profile and wants to ask you out on a date. Time is of the essence! 

On another note, don&#039;t you think that the designs of the emails can be improved? I generally don&#039;t like the look of any of them. Particuarly Zoosk one - I don&#039;t like that bright blue colour. it looks cheesy. But I guess it might fit with their other branding. I do like the simplicity of the Badoo email with the Yes/No options.]]></description>
