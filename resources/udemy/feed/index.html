		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jimmy and Jen for the great write up!  I wanted to put another test out there.  

Our company helps businesses personalize emails and we’ve found
similar results expressed in this blog post. While personalizing email can be
as trivial as “Dear Jimmy Daly”, you can also take it to the next level like
this:

or something like

Hopefully this comment does come off as too “spammy”. Just thought I would introduce
another level of personalizing emails for those willing to test.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jen!  This is great stuff.  It would be lovely to see how this works with projects where there is more than a single response/no-response outcome.  I mean, for instance, I help out a dance instructor with her marketing.  But her message is not always about come to class/don&#039;t come to class.  So it gets complicated.  Anyway -- great stuff!]]></description>
