		<description><![CDATA[Great point Jason. The trick here is to setup an email like &quot;laurenm@yourdomain.com&quot; that actually goes to a support desk, so anyone can handle it. This is a conscious choice and, if you&#039;re in B2B, you may actually want it going back to the sales team member - but in B2C and at large scale this is a great hack to achieve the end goal!]]></description>

Maybe Laura could answer all email replies but with a larger company, how do you tackle this? Or maybe the content is 95% of what makes this email effective and sender doesn&#039;t really matter...]]></description>
