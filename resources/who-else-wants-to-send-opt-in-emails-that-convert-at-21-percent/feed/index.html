		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind comment Shameer. I certainly think that there are lots of ways to improve on traditional email marketing and there is no doubt it&#039;s a direct channel to the customer! This is a great example from Maria of successful email marketing :).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris, this is a wonderful post! Some great stats and brainstorm ideas you have provided here. I have had clients who ask me whether email marketing&#039;s dead? I can&#039;t imagine why they would ask that, apart from something that tells me it&#039;s not working for them! They&#039;re doing it all wrong and I have seen it with my own eyes. This is a good post to direct them to.


Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
