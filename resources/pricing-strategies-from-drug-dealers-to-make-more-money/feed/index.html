		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for your reply! It made me switch to a 14-day trial. On freemium, my conversion to paying customers/users is 0.2% which I find too low for a SAAS. I hope that it will increase significantly by switching to a 14-day trial model. Cheers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great question. The answer depends on a number of factors, including whether you have the resources to support a huge number of non-paying users. In addition, consider if the audience should pay. For example, people have different expectations of Google as a search user or Google as an advertiser. Google may offer a free credit to get started with advertising, but you are going to pay for that eventually. In other situations, non-paying users are useful if they can create a network effect or you have other ways to monetize them. Don&#039;t count on a large percentage of them upgrading to paid plans. Some will hit usage triggers and upgrade, but many are there simply for the &quot;free&quot;. There&#039;s a huge change in demand between free and non-free. As a general rule of thumb, B2B apps are more likely to be free trial and B2C apps are more likely to be freemium.]]></description>
