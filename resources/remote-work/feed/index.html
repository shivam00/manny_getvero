		<description><![CDATA[Having worked remotely fr home for 8 years now, the tools are there to function and get results. Try it for a few hours a week at first, see the challenges, then adapt if its for you. You&#039;ll miss that &#039;anger in the office&#039; at your lazy co workers that bring their wackiness to work. You&#039;ll realize work is not breaking rocks all day, we live with peaks n valley of productivity. You do need an All Star Team around you, fr the local tech guy that recommends the right keyboard to a virtual assistant that appreciates the Skype training once a week. Going simple helps, Chromebooks coupled with a real CRM and a used Nexus 5 allow you to tack on Rapportive, Ebsta, Phonami, Phonedeck, Nimble, Insightly, Base and Ace of Sales and definitely ScheduleOnce or Calendly. Headsets.com is another All Star. 


I set appointments in 8 time zones, 15hrs a day on call 24/7, and incoming emails are amazed at a simple, humane reply, then decide on stock email replies, automated email campaigns depending on the response. 


Coffee shops and libraries are getting PACKED with telecommuting workers, so expect to get creative to find new spots to work smartly. Car dealerships, McDonalds, Subways, can work if its quiet.  Entire cities are wired, like St. George, UT and Stevenson, WA.  


Life isn&#039;t quiet, and expect a ton of rude idiots talking so loud even though they can see you hugging a phone. Get to know the larger coffee shops in town and tip them well, then start researching the giant database of new co working hotel lobbies, spare offices etc  near you as a professional break.  


New cities to work in sound cool, but expect to hustle to find consistent power, Net access. Joining LinkedIn barely helps your career, all the social apps are so busy selling something you have to flip the equation. Get your own Private Group on LinkedIn, delete any losers in FB.  Twitter can be a resource of ideas, tips, but it too gets noisy with ads.  


Remote is the future, true your phone ties you down, but if you&#039;re a responsive, motivated worker you win.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been lucky enough to work remotely (i.e. at home) for about 6 months now. This has allowed us to move to be closer to support for kids. Mostly it is fine. You have to make an effort to see people - I pop out to a coffee shop to work sometimes and also meet relatives for lunch. Oddly, I miss the commute sometimes - it was a barrier   between the house and work - me time. But it&#039;s good to re-gain 2 h of my life. Trying to get out for cycles when I can. Instant messaging is great for keeping in touch with colleagues and skype is a must for 1:1 meetings. Webex also great for meetings. It&#039;s great to be able to play music too. 
I tend to use my laptop like a desktop while at home as I can use a big screen (when the weather improves - I&#039;m in Scotland - I&#039;ll probably venture to the garden :-)). 
Twitter is also a great place to keep in touch. I have a network of learning &#038; development twitter buddies. I&#039;m at @julianstaddon if anyone wants to swap notes and working tips]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find that it takes less discipline to work at home than it did in my office days. In the office, there are sooo many distractions. At home, there are fewer because I&#039;ve arranged it to be that way.

Have you checked out Remotive.io? Lots of good articles on this stuff (and a jobs board too).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its actually quite frustrating how backwards about remote working most Australian companies are. Perhaps it a cultural thing in Australia or something else entirely, but most bosses in Australia still seem very anti-remote working or work-from-home, or at-least it seems very few and far between. There is even a lack of job listing sites for Australians to find jobs that promote such work conditions. Instead Aussies are faced to look abroad in the USA and UK where remote jobs are listed more freely and clearly. 

Working from home / remotely does require a-lot of discipline and scheduling as it can be very easy to procrastinate, be distracted by non-work related tasks or slacken off. I personally loved not enduring commuting, being in my own space and own set time-constraints / schedule. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also work for a remote team where we have team members in a few countries and time zones. I myself have been working from London for just over 4 years while the head office is in Germany. Our company makes online meeting software for teams to collaborate together despite distance - so we talk the talk and, most importantly, walk the walk! :-) 

A few months ago I even went to Barcelona for a week and worked remotely while I was there. Why not? We&#039;ve got the tools at our fingertips to enable such a remote working lifestyle. For those of you who are not able to work remotely on a regular basis but want to try it for a short stint, I wrote a post on how to make this happen https://www.mikogo.com/2014/09/11/work-remotely-abroad-week-barcelona/

Of course it&#039;s not for everyone. It takes disciplince, drive and self-motivation. You won&#039;t get that same &quot;push&quot; that you get when you step into an office. And that&#039;s very important for managers to consider as well when they&#039;re looking to hire workers remotely.]]></description>
