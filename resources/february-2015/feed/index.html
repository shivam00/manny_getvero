The Backlinko case study is definitely the most in-depth: backlinko.com/content-strategy/



I&#039;ll make a note to talk about our SEO strategy in some upcoming posts. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great results, Jimmy!

I&#039;ve noticed that getting featured in newsletters can bring quite a lot of traffic! So right now I&#039;m trying to collect the most noteable ones so that I could pitch them whenever I publish an &quot;epic post&quot; :) (and you&#039;ve just contributed to that list lol)

btw.. do you have an article about your SEO strategy? it seems google works really well for you.. would love to read about your experience of taming Google :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big proponent of going deep, not wide. I&#039;d rather focusing my time getting as much from one channel as possible rather getting a little bit from a number of channels.

Here&#039;s a good post on the topic: http://blog.asmartbear.com/one-channel.html]]></description>
