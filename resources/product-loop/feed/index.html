I bought a book on my Kindle about a year ago. I just finished it last week, and I got an email from Amazon asking for a review. That means they are tracking &quot;finished Kindle book&quot; as an event to trigger emails. Amazing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@disqus_NpZ1rILyMc:disqus That&#039;s interesting about Amazon. They are known for testing so I&#039;m guessing they are trying to find the right timing for you, or they could be basing it off the length of the books. I don&#039;t put anything past them. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Think Amazon is still trying to figure out when I finish books - sometimes I get an email 2 weeks later, sometimes 4 weeks. Even then I&#039;ve not finished! Ha! 


Think what all of the these emails have in common is how unobtrusive they are. They&#039;re just a part of the &quot;flow&quot; and those sort of emails we can be trained into being okay to receive and open and read through.]]></description>
