		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re missing Alex&#039;s point and my point. Google is personalizing your search results based on what you like, visit, etc. You see Vero&#039;s G+ result above Copyblogger&#039;s because Google has figured out (correctly) that Vero is very important to you. No one else will see Vero above Copyblogger. In fact, I see neither Vero nor Copyblogger in my search results for that same term because neither is &quot;important&quot; to me.


So yes, if you can get tons of people to circle your G+ page then those people &quot;may&quot; see your G+ page come up when they do search related to content you have on your G+ page. But getting thousands or even tens of thousands of people to circle you is a daunting task and, even then, that number will pale in comparison to the hundreds of millions of people searching everyday where you really need to compete for SEO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re missing Alex&#039;s point. You&#039;re only seeing those G+ links above actual content because you&#039;ve told Google those pages are important to you by circling them. Try searching in incognito mode (to block any cookies you may have, ensure you&#039;re not logged in, etc.) and the results will likely look very different, with no G+ pages on the first results page. I doubt there is much, if any, real SEO value to creating G+ &quot;doorway&quot; pages.]]></description>
