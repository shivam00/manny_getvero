When they pay for our product, why aren&#039;t we sending them real thank you packages like dollar shave club? I&#039;m sure this would help with retention and brand building.... Makes me want to rethink everything i&#039;ve done for our startup.]]></description>

I agree that this model is better suited for B2C. Look for some videos about how to maximize Vero in the very near future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow Jimmy! this is a fantastic blog (lots and lots of work for you as well) about a super cool B2C product.

Since I&#039;m opinionated like hell, I feel the urge to comment on two points:
1) for B2B, I believe that anything on Facebook (fanpage/retargeting)  is a waste of precious time and money
2) in B2B I ONLY care about relevance (we all have only so much time). for example, Steli Efti writes ONLY about selling ...and sells a B2B SaaS CMR. And, I wished that you guys only wrote about tricks on how to use GetVero better :-)

But, you guys disprove both my points AND are successful ... ]]></description>
