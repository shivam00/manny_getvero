		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Perform an email audit. Here is a classic email marketing problem. A company sends promotional emails that few people open and read but sends transactional emails â€” receipts, notifications, welcome notes, etc. â€” that lots of people read and open. The issue is that transactional emails are opened at up to 8x the rate of promotional emails yet they have little to no marketing value.The key is finding the sweet spot. An email that people need and actually want to open but that also moves them closer to a sales goal.Your transactional emails are likely sent by a third party, so they accomplish a function but do nothing for your marketing efforts. Find every email that your customers could possibly receive from you or on your behalf and start optimizing them. You can read A LOT more on transactional email here. [&#8230;]]]></description>
