		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using videos in my emails for a long time now, and have noticed that people just LOVE videos so much more than text. BUT - I haven&#039;t actually embedded the videos in the email, as I&#039;ve wanted to make it a priority for them to actually click through. This is definitely something to experiment with, and test! Excellent post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Christos! Thanks for leaving a comment. 

I think we&#039;d need to see more info from your tests to figure this out. For example, we&#039;d need to know what kind of GIFs you used. Some GIFs are static, while others are animated (which, I read somewhere, some email clients have trouble showing, just like they do showing video). 

On the other hand, remember what Aaron said which backs up this post&#039;s point; videos always improve CTR, even over images. The thing is, most email clients can show JPEGs and GIFs equally (once the email user allows images to be shown), but videos are still a whole other breed of marketing at this point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aaron and Bree i agree that GIFs are an innovative way of increasing your CTR. Despite that general fact, i&#039;m working as a Project Leader for the E-mail Marketing in an Online Travel Agency, called Travelplanet24.com(Our global brand name is &quot;Tripsta&quot;) and after making twice an A/B test between a JPEG and a GIF, i saw that there wasn&#039;t any difference between their CTRs. 
Do you have any statistics to share from your tests?


Greetings from Greece,

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Franco,

We don&#039;t yet have a &#039;merge&#039; tag that will automatically insert a video but I will put together a knowledge base article on how it can be done. In essence you should be able to include the HTML5 embed code!

Although not our own blog, check this out: http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3529/html5-video-in-email-an-updated-guide-for-2011/]]></description>
