		<description><![CDATA[Nice 1 Jimmy. I think the web is going bananas with popups at the moment, what&#039;s your view? Sumome has taken over! (well not completely but it is all over the place) I think it&#039;s going to burn out, especially when hardly anyone is customising the Sumome popup.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jimmy... one thing I&#039;d add to this...


EMPATHY


Crafting a buyer persona (or buyer personas) and outlining their common objections, motivations, and sales triggers is vital to creating an effective marketing gameplan... 


And obviously email marketing / marketing automation builds from that...


If your emails have:


1.  Strong copywriting (probably the biggest shortcoming in the digital marketing world today)...


2.  Leave your target audience thinking &quot;I feel like he/she wrote this specifically for me&quot; ....


then you should be well on your way to success....(opens, CTR, conversions)


Great post as always... Thanks Jimmy!]]></description>
