		<description><![CDATA[Stevie - that&#039;s a massive compliment. Thanks!  As to your comment, I&#039;d love to learn a little more (chris@getvero.com if you&#039;d like) but my general answer is: of course you know enough about the industry. 9.9 times out of 10 when I talk to people with this fear, they usually have a fair bit of experience preparing content or ideas in the space they&#039;re in and it&#039;s usually worth putting together the best emails you can (even 2-3 at first) and get them out there. You&#039;ll usually be surprised by how well received they are man!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Probably the best post I have seen yet. The problem I have is that what do you do if you know how to put the emails together but you are not experienced enough in a particular industry to provide your subscribers with useful information? Is it best to do research and then pretend you are an authority on the subject?]]></description>
