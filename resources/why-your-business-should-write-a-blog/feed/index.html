		<description><![CDATA[Should every business have a blog? Absolutely and you&#039;ve cited a few great leaders in Rand and Neil, both of them ooze authority. Gone are the days where a blog was set up for the sake of adding fresh content. We are now at a point where your customers turn to a blog to suss out your knowledge and the quality of information you provide. For example, Neil might only post once-twice a week on QuickSprout but each of these posts are high quality which generate social signals and links. Well articulated post!]]></description>
