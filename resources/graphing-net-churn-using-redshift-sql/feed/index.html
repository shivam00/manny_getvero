		<description><![CDATA[Spot on Henry. I didn&#039;t get into much detail on this post â€“ but the truth is we actually add payments outside Stripe to the chart in this example by cross-querying our application database (Postgres) alongside the Redshift database that Pipeline pushes to. We store the invoices we send out through Xero in that database. Even in such a simple example, without the ability to query across databases, we wouldn&#039;t get an accurate portrayal of these figures.

I think the next post will either go further down this route, or it&#039;ll be looking at an example of creating powerful email analytics using SQL :). Or...both, in due course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great Chris! Thanks for using RJMetrics and Pipeline.

The key thing to celebrate here is the potential and, in actuality, the imperative to query across databases. Without that you&#039;re at best getting a siloed view of the performance data within each of your systems and tools. At worst you&#039;re totally missing out on a comprehensive view of the customer and their experience and, of course, opportunities to optimize and improve that experience to the point that it results in growing revenue... 

I&#039;m glad to see you all are so excited about this. So are we, which is why we built Pipeline. :) I&#039;m looking forward to your next post on the topic... perhaps looking at Stripe revenue growth and churn by usage and engagement data pulled out of your Postgres database?

P.S. We&#039;re big Vero fans as well. Pipeline uses Vero in a big way, and our onboarding strategy wouldn&#039;t work without Vero&#039;s help.]]></description>
