		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] There are a few ways to go about tracking your competitors&#8217; email marketing. You can, and should, head to their sites and sign up for their emails. Next, create a folder or label in your inbox where you can route all their messages. I recommend having the messages skip your inbox so you aren&#8217;t bombarded by them all day long. It&#8217;s just a place where you can go to see what they are up to when you have a few minutes to spare. It&#8217;s the equivalent of a swipe file. [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alyce,

Looks like there&#039;s an error on the Wistia subscription form.

On Chrome when I submit the url shows and error but nothing is displayed on the page
http://wistia.com/blog?email=Subscribe&#038;errorMessage=Please+correct+the+following+errors%3A~~~+-+This+field+is+required.~~~&#038;allFields=&#038;errors=true



On firefox it just clears the form.


Cheers,
Mark]]></description>
