<html><body><p>We&rsquo;re close to releasing mobile push notifications and, in anticipation, I wanted to share what this feature will encompass and how it will fit into your workflow.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, we&rsquo;ve been working hard to bring you two powerful new tools:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.getvero.com/workflows/">Workflows</a> (now live) &ndash; a visual canvas that makes it easy to design and manage complex customer journeys.</li>
<li>Support for multiple messaging channels, the first addition being iOS and Android push notifications. </li>
</ul><p>Together these tools enable you to send timely, personal and actionable messages to your customers, on their preferred channels.</p>
<h1>Mobile push notifications in Vero </h1>
<p>We&rsquo;re super excited by the release of mobile push notifications as they introduce the first new messaging channel to sit alongside email in Vero. By opening up the channels through which you can communicate with your customers, we&rsquo;re giving you a whole new set of tools to engage your customers and ensure that they have a great experience with your business.</p>
<p>For many customers, Vero has become a &ldquo;defacto&rdquo; CRM and the central data store for rich data used to create targeted messages and interact with customers. Going beyond emails gives you more ways to use this data and increase the value of your integration with Vero.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7760" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-ios-android-push-notifications/push-node2x/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?fit=1200%2C620&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Push notifications" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?fit=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?fit=1024%2C529&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=1200%2C620&#038;ssl=1" alt="Push notifications" width="1200" height="620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7760" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=768%2C397&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=1024%2C529&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built a dedicated, user-friendly and powerful UI for creating iOS and Android push messages, to provide an experience on par with Vero&rsquo;s email creation process.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into the design and approach, including how channel data is stored on user profiles, how push notification tracking is handled and how the campaign creation process is structured.</p>
<p>In adding our first new channel to sit alongside email, we also re-architected several components of Vero to allow mobile push notifications to be the first of many new channels and integrations.</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>Below is a summary of the key things you need to know regarding the upcoming release. We&rsquo;ve also written a <a href="https://help.getvero.com/articles/mobile-push-notification-integration-guide.html">detailed integration guide</a>. Whilst this feature is in beta, feel free to read and provide feedback on the integration process as we prepare for the full release of this feature. We&rsquo;ll be adding more help docs soon.</p>
<h2>Selecting a delivery provider</h2>
<p>From customer feedback, it was clear that the majority of customers leverage either AWS SNS or Twilio for their push infrastructure and they would like to extend the value of these two providers with Vero.  The first version of our push notification support will include integrations with both these providers and we intend to add more in the future. </p>
<p>Similar to Vero&rsquo;s support for Mailgun, Sendgrid, Mailjet and other email delivery platforms, you will be able to add one or more <em>Providers</em> to handle push and choose on a campaign-by-campaign basis which provider to use.</p>
<h2>Managing multiple devices and tokens</h2>
<p>Unlike email addresses, it is feasible for customers to:</p>
<ul><li>have one or more devices,</li>
<li>uninstall and reinstall applications; and</li>
<li>have devices across platforms (ie. both iOS and Android)</li>
</ul><p>For this reason, Vero will support multiple device tokens per customer profile in Vero so that you can easily add and manage tokens for each customer.</p>
<p>Vero will support adding tokens via API and CSV. To integrate fully, we anticipate customers passing the token to Vero from their backend as part of the push notification registration. In the majority of cases, we have seen that customers are already doing this in some form or another as part of their current integration with AWS or Twilio, so Vero&rsquo;s integration should be straightforward compared with installing and shipping a Vero-specific SDK in a new version of your application.</p>
<h2>Creating a campaign with push notifications</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built a separate, dedicated UI for creating a push notification instead of an email. This includes both a basic editor for the main push notification controls and an advanced editor for those who wish to edit the full JSON payloads.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="7763" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-ios-android-push-notifications/push-editor-basic2x/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?fit=1200%2C674&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,674" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Push message Editor" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?fit=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=1200%2C674&#038;ssl=1" alt="Push message Editor " width="1200" height="674" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7763" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>In the upcoming release, Vero will support Android and iOS push messages and our editor will be designed to work seamlessly with this pairing. This includes a preview of the push message on each platform and targeting options to limit the send to iOS, Android or both as desired.</p>
<p>The editor will otherwise mirror the email campaign creation process so it should be easy to use and familiar.</p>
<p>Similar to email, you will have the option to send a push notification as a newsletter campaign or add as an action step in a workflow.</p>
<h2>Measuring customer engagement </h2>
<p>Measuring customer engagement with iOS and Android push notifications is centered on tracking &ldquo;did a user open this message&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve extended our API to make it easy to track this engagement. By incorporating a few lines of code in your application as part of your iOS/ Android push notification handling, you can track and monitor the performance of your push notifications directly in Vero. </p>
<p>Performance metrics for push notifications will be available to view on the action step in your workflow, and in the Reports section of your account.</p>
<h1>When is it coming?</h1>
<p>Push notifications will be released in beta next week. If you haven&rsquo;t already, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Iiqw8Ba3lpQBSan9znKwHoOM9qXhL560l53zwLbv8dK_CA/viewform">sign up for the beta</a> and get early access: we&rsquo;re excited to get your feedback as we finalize this new feature.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to push this feature live!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>We&rsquo;re excited to tell you that Workflows are now available to all our customers!<br>
This new feature will make it easier and faster for you to design and manage your email journeys in Vero. Whether your journeys are simple or complex, Workflows empower you to communicate with your customers more confidently.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we shared that we&rsquo;d been building out Workflows and included <a href="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/">notes on our design approach and the key features</a>. We&rsquo;ve had Workflows in beta for some time now and we&rsquo;ve received some great feedback, so we&rsquo;re excited to see it go live today!</p>
<h2>Design journeys with clarity and confidence</h2>
<p>By using a canvas with point-and-click nodes, we have strived to make it as easy as possible to design any customer journey, whether it&rsquo;s short or long, simple or complex.</p>

<p>This level of visibility ensures any member of your team can easily pick up from where you left off and confidently update and optimize campaigns.</p>
<h2>Easily monitor performance and optimize campaigns</h2>
<p>Along with performance statistics shown on each action step, workflow insights are displayed in the sidebar allowing you to easily track customers, monitor the performance, identify areas for improvement, and make changes &ndash; all in one place.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve published a workflow, you&rsquo;ll often want to come back and make adjustments to optimize email content, timing and other variables. Steps can be moved during a live workflow, so you can easily adjust your campaigns as you learn and gain insights into your customers&rsquo; behaviour.</p>

<p>Vero will provide helpful messages to keep you right when making changes to live workflows.</p>
<h2>The little things matter</h2>
<p>Our goal has been to ensure Workflows are a joy to use. Some of the details we&rsquo;ve focused on include:</p>
<ul><li>Basic configuration of each step is immediately visible on the canvas, and the sidebar gives access to all of the configuration options, to provide clarity of functionality when designing and amending the details of each step.</li>
<li>Color-coded steps to help you see what&rsquo;s happening at a glance and make it easy to identify different aspects of your workflow.</li>
<li>Zooming and panning features mean you can easily view both simple and complex (long!) messaging workflows. Whether it&rsquo;s two steps or 200, our shortcut buttons and keys make it easy for you to fly around your canvas.</li>
</ul><h2>Coming soon!</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Workflows is that it provides almost endless possibilities to help you better communicate with your customers across channels and in more specific, action-oriented ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already designed several feature additions and extensions we&rsquo;re excited to roll out over the coming months. These include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Mobile push notifications</strong><br>
We&rsquo;re adding support for Twilio and AWS SNS as an action step within Workflows within the next few weeks. This will enable a whole new world of cross-channel possibilities!
</li>
<li><strong>Convergence</strong><br>
One of the most powerful components of Workflows is the ability to branch indefinitely. Similarly, there are times when it makes sense to &ldquo;converge&rdquo; branches too, bringing a journey back to a central point. We&rsquo;re exploring ways to ensure your journeys are as simple, transparent and powerful as possible and convergence is near the top of the list.
</li>
<li><strong>A/B testing</strong><br>
There is lots of room for expansion in A/B testing capability with Workflows, including allowing you to A/B test varying branches of a journey. A/B testing is a nuanced area, and we&rsquo;re excited to incorporate your feedback as we build out these features.
</li>
</ul><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of scope beyond the above, for what&rsquo;s possible, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to your feedback and comments, as we build on this awesome feature!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>One of the big projects Vero has planned this year is the release of our new campaign workflows for email communications and mobile push notifications. This new feature will give you a more visual way to design and manage your customer journeys. We&rsquo;ve been delighted with the initial rounds of feedback and we&rsquo;re getting ready to launch in the next few weeks, so we thought you might like a sneak preview.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>At Vero, we know that team collaboration and visibility of your data is key to designing and successfully implementing personalized email campaigns. While Vero&rsquo;s current email campaign tools are very powerful, the current linear campaign builder doesn&rsquo;t offer complete visibility of an email journey in one view.</p>
<p>We spent time speaking to both our new and long-time customers to understand the areas where we can improve how you can build and manage campaigns:</p>
<ol><li>It is sometimes hard to have confidence in where customers are in their email journey. This fear can sometimes hold users back from further developing a workflow and adding more sophisticated and personalized email campaigns.
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of Vero customers have tens, or in some cases, hundreds of automated email campaigns. Collaboration at scale can be tough &ndash; people think differently and it can be hard for one Vero user to &ldquo;follow the logic&rdquo; of campaigns set up by their teammate, which can often make updating or changing them daunting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of branching leads to duplication. Vero&rsquo;s current interface enables very detailed functionality, but it&rsquo;s linear nature often means duplicating a whole workflow in order to adjust one or a few elements of the workflow. Introducing ways to achieve personalization without duplication is a critical goal of Vero&rsquo;s new campaign workflows.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2 id="campaign-workflow-highlights">New campaign workflow highlights</h2>
<p>Our key goal in designing this new campaign workflow was to make it as easy as possible for anyone, on any team, to collaborate on customer messages and to have confidence in what customers will receive. We&rsquo;re delighted to share this preview with you today.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7666" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/vcb2x/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?fit=1200%2C764&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,764" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Campaign workflow UI" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?fit=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?fit=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=1200%2C764&#038;ssl=1" alt="Campaign workflow" width="1200" height="764" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7666" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This new visual approach to building campaigns offers you a clean and clear view of all the logic, details and content that make-up highly engaging campaigns. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Color-coded steps help you see what&rsquo;s happening at a glance and make it easy to identify different aspects of your workflow. </li>
<li>The basic configuration of each step is immediately visible on the canvas, and the sidebar gives you detailed access to all of the configuration options for each, providing clarity of functionality when designing and amending the details of each step.</li>
<li>Zooming and panning features mean you can easily view both simple and complex (long!) messaging workflows. Whether it&rsquo;s two nodes or 200, our shortcut buttons and keys make it easy to fly around your canvas.</li>
</ul><p>Together, these features will give you, and your team, the visibility and clarity to move quickly, and confidently develop and improve your customer journeys.</p>
<h2>Modular and extensible</h2>
<p>Critical to the longevity of this feature is its modularity. The release of visual campaign workflows opens the door to possibilities that we could previously only imagine.<br>
We&rsquo;ve architected the new workflow manager with the future in mind. Not only will the first version improve on our current automation engine by including new functions such as branching, in the future, we&rsquo;ll be releasing several new nodes too such as push notifications &ndash; we&rsquo;ll be sharing more on that soon.</p>

<p>One of the major improvements that campaign workflows give over the current automated campaign interface in Vero is <strong>flexibility</strong>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7670" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/drag2x/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?fit=1200%2C622&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,622" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Campaign workflow nodes" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?fit=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?fit=1024%2C531&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?resize=1200%2C622&#038;ssl=1" alt="Moving campaign workflow nodes" width="1200" height="622" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7670" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?resize=768%2C398&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Drag@2x.png?resize=1024%2C531&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The position of each step in a campaign is no longer restricted. Steps can be moved around, giving you full control over the order of logic, delays, and emails. These steps can also be moved during a live campaign so you can adjust your campaign as you learn and gain insights into your customers&rsquo; behavior. We are confident this feature will provide a level of flexibility that will make creating and managing journeys much faster and simpler.</p>
<h2>Branching</h2>
<p>One of the best new features included in this release is the ability to add branching steps to a workflow. By adding logic that results in the customer moving down either a true or false path means you can tailor your customer journeys even further.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7668" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/branch2x/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?fit=1200%2C628&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Campaign workflow branches" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?fit=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?fit=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=1200%2C628&#038;ssl=1" alt="Campaign workflow branches" width="1200" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7668" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=768%2C402&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We think managing your campaign logic like this will make planning and implementing customer journeys easier than ever. Not only does it mean you can skip the pen and paper, and plan out your campaigns directly in Vero, it also means you can combine multiple campaigns into a single workflow so you and your team can view more complex journeys on one canvas.</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got a series of customer emails up and running, you&rsquo;ll often want to come back and adjustments to optimize the content, timing and other variables.</p>
<p>Campaign workflows handle changes elegantly, ensuring that any design changes are not activated until you officially push them live. This lets you change email content or the entire node structure without worrying about affecting what your customers see &ndash; until you&rsquo;re happy with the changes.</p>
<h2>Clarity at every step</h2>
<p>By introducing a canvas for designing campaigns you can create more sophisticated, and longer email sequences with many branches. Setting a &ldquo;goal&rdquo; for the workflow not only offers clarity around when customers are or are not in a workflow, it drives conversion tracking across the workflow as a whole &ndash; aggregating conversions across the individual messages and reporting the success of the workflow in one place.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also ensured that you can easily reference workflows when designing segments or other workflows, using the condition &ldquo;Has entered workflow&rdquo;. This gives you extra power for all of your detailed campaign design needs.</p>
<hr><p>A couple of the features I&rsquo;ve previewed today are still in the works, but we&rsquo;re nearly ready to show you what we&rsquo;ve built. We&rsquo;ll start to open up our new visual campaign workflows to a small number of beta customers in the coming weeks.<br>
If you&rsquo;re interested in being part of the beta group, send us an email support@getvero.com.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really excited to release this feature, and we hope you are too!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>When A/B testing an email newsletter you can now let Vero automatically pick and send the winning email to the remaining recipients. Vero makes A/B testing easy to manage while providing the level of accuracy required to ensure your tests are robust so that you can confidently optimize the performance of your campaigns.</p>
<h3>Winning metrics that matter</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re in control of the parameters used for your A/B tests. Define the <em>time to wait</em> before the winning variance is selected, the <em>percentage of customers to use in the test</em> and the <em>metric to determine the winner</em>.</p>
<p>You can choose from the following metrics to determine which variation wins:</p>
<ul><li>Deliveries</li>
<li>Opens</li>
<li>Clicks</li>
<li>Unsubscribes (the variant with more unsubscribes will be discarded)</li>
<li>Conversions (the number of users that took an action after receiving the campaign, such as a purchase).</li>

<p>You can select from two options to determine the winner:</p>
<h3>Biggest number</h3>
<p>In this scenario, Vero will select the email with the biggest number of the chosen metric as the winner (with exception of unsubscribes, where the variant with the biggest number will be discarded).</p>
<h3>Statistical significance</h3>
<p>Statistical significance brings mathematical accuracy to your testing. If one of your email variations observes an improvement on the control email with a confidence level of 95%, it will be selected as the winning email and sent to the remaining audience.  If no statistically significant difference is observed between the email variations, Vero will send the control email to the remaining audience.</p>

<html><body><p>Vero&rsquo;s Fusion functionality allows you to access your most accurate data when you need it.</p>
<p>With Fusion you can <strong>pull data</strong> from your own internal APIs or public API endpoints right before emails are sent, providing the accuracy and timeliness needed to deliver your customers a truly personalized experience.</p>
<p>Many of our customers have been using Fusion over the last few months and we&rsquo;ve been delighted with the feedback. Today we&rsquo;re excited to offer Fusion to all our customers!</p>
<h2>Load data from its source</h2>
<p>Vero&rsquo;s Fusion uses APIs to access data where it originates: directly from internal databases or third-party platforms. Using Fusion follows a simple two-step process:</p>
<p><strong>Connect an API endpoint</strong></p>
<p>Add the URL of your external data source to an email using <strong>Vero&rsquo;s Data Inspector</strong>. To enable loading individual, specific user and event data, Vero can pass identifying attributes with each API request (such as a user&rsquo;s ID or email).</p>
<p><strong>Add data to emails using Liquid</strong></p>
<p>Data is loaded for access using the HTML templating language Liquid. This enables you to access the full JSON object and insert attributes (or HTML) into your email content, just this: <code>{{external.user_region}}</code>.</p>
<hr><section id="external-attributes-code" class="flush-bottom"><div class="inner center-text">
<div>
<p class="smallish semi-bold no-margin">Example API endpoint</p>
<p class="no-top-margin">https://api.yoursite.com/people-you-may-know/{{user.id}}</p>
</div>
<div class="ext-example">
<div class="ext-example-json">
<pre class="top-margin-small okaidia" data-src="/wp-content/themes/vero/snippets/fusion-json.json"></pre>
</div>
<div class="ext-example-html">
<pre class="top-margin-small" data-src="/wp-content/themes/vero/snippets/fusion-html.html"></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</section><hr><p>Fusion provides the data accuracy and timeliness that enables a new level of personalization, ensuring your emails are being rendered on a truly one-to-one basis.</p>
<h2>Email as a true extension of your product</h2>
<p>Fusion leverages the data you use to power personal content on your website, in your application or across other customer-facing tools, enabling you to craft superior interactions off-site in your emails. Examples include:</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Access data models and create dynamically calculated product recommendation emails tailored specifically to each customer.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Data and Charts</strong></p>
<p>Pull complex data structures or even fully rendered HTML charts to deliver unique weekly updates with usage details to each customer.</p>
<p><strong>Delightful details</strong></p>
<p>Impress your users with personalized enriched data pulled from services like OpenWeather, Clearbit and more.</p>
<hr><p>Fusion is now available to all our customers &ndash; our help center has an updated guide with details on <a href="https://help.getvero.com/articles/what-are-external-attributes">how to use Fusion</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>To kick off 2018, we&rsquo;ve revamped email campaign reporting in Vero! The Reports section is now sporting a smoother UI and additional filters that will enable you to access your email campaign data with greater granularity. We&rsquo;ve also improved the robustness of our webhooks to help you join up your data from Vero with the rest of your data, giving you access to the insights that are important to your specific business.</p>
<h2 class="top-margin-medium">What&rsquo;s New</h2>
<p><a href="https://app.getvero.com/reports"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7552" src="https://i1.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vero_Reports_UI.png?resize=1300%2C764&#038;ssl=1" alt="Vero Reports UI" width="1300" height="764"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<h3>Custom date ranges</h3>
<p>Previously you could view your campaign results for 7, 30 and 90 day windows &ndash; with this latest update you can select your own beginning and end dates. The results will include:</p>
<ul><li>aggregate data for the date range you&rsquo;ve specified</li>
<li>a breakdown of engagement data day-by-day, both charted and tabulated</li>
<li>total and unique clicks on each individual link within that time range</li>
</ul><h3>Support for variations and languages</h3>
<p>You can now drill down from the campaign level of Reports and see individual results for email variations and even languages. You can also filter this view by selecting a custom date range.</p>
<h3>A total overview of your campaigns</h3>
<p>Many of you requested an overview report of your sends across all of your campaigns, both so you can track total send volume over time and fluctuations in engagement. With this release you can do just that!</p>
<h3>A smoother UI</h3>
<p>The UI for Reports has now been brought into line with the rest of our UI, built on top of a modern Javascript framework. You should find navigating reports and moving back-and-forth from other components in our application a lot faster now.</p>
<p>Full details of the new reporting features are available in our <a href="https://help.getvero.com/#reporting">support documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Improved</h2>
<h3 id="custom-reports">Custom Reports</h3>
<p>To help each of our customers access the insights that are important to their specific business, we&rsquo;ve also focused on improving the robustness of our webhook pipeline. Many of our customers now set up their data flow like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://help.getvero.com/articles/setting-up-veros-webhooks"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7550" src="https://i0.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Vero-webhooks-pipeline.png?resize=1200%2C516&#038;ssl=1" alt="Vero webhooks pipeline" width="1200" height="516"  data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Vero&rsquo;s integrations with <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/integrations/vero/">Stitch Data</a> and <a href="https://segment.com/sources/vero">Segment</a> allow you to extract, transform and load (ETL) all of the data that Vero generates from your campaigns to Redshift, Google Big Query and other data stores with &ldquo;one-click&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As per our <a href="https://help.getvero.com/articles/setting-up-veros-webhooks">webhook documentation</a>, Vero will send a webhook for all of the data that originates from a Vero campaign:</p>
<ul><li>Email delivered</li>
<li>Email failed</li>
<li>Email opened</li>
<li>Email clicked</li>
<li>Email converted</li>
</ul><p>Joining up your email campaign data with other data (such as internal application usage and payment information) in your data warehouse will provide you with a more complete and accurate data set.</p>
<p>Using a BI tool, like Mode Analytics, you can query your data and build custom reports that are important to your specific business. Imagine querying whether customers with higher negative churn two years into their usage of your product read your newsletters weekly. This sort of specificity requires joining data stores. With the strength of data stores like Redshift, Big Query and Snowflake, we are committed to ensuring you can build these queries by giving you your data as quickly and with as much granularity as possible.</p>
<h3>The ideal workflow</h3>
<p><strong>Vero&rsquo;s internal reporting feature</strong> is designed to help you:</p>
<ul><li>Monitor the overall results for key email campaign metrics</li>
<li>Chart and export day-by-day metrics for your campaigns to understand the fluctuations of results over time, particularly for automated campaigns</li>
<li>Understand how each email within a series drives different results</li>
<li>Review results from one campaign to the next, ensuring consistency and stability</li>
<li>Compare the results of A/B tests you conduct using Vero</li>
<li>Compare the results of different languages within a specific campaign</li>
</ul><p><strong>Our webhooks</strong> enables you to join your data in Vero with other data, such as payment information, to get an even more specific picture of the results your campaigns drive.</p>
<p>We will continue to work on integrations and documentation to support these use cases as the technology in this space continues to improve.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about reports or how to use Vero&rsquo;s webhooks with your own data pipeline, drop us an email at <a href="mailto:support@getvero.com">support@getvero.com</a>. We&rsquo;d also welcome your feedback and ideas.</p></body></html>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getvero.com/resources/vero-and-gdpr-compliance/">Vero and GDPR compliance</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.getvero.com">Vero</a>.</p>
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>If you sell/offer products or services to customers based in the EU, you will by now have heard of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of our work towards GDPR compliance, along with the changes and information you can expect from Vero as we approach the deadline on 25 May 2018.</p>
<h2>What is GDPR and who does it apply to?</h2>
<p>The GDPR is EU regulation designed to protect the privacy of EU citizens and will have an impact on every organization that processes the personal data of such citizens, regardless of whether the organization itself is based in the EU or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personal data&rdquo; means any piece of data that, used alone or with other data, can identify an individual.</p>
<p>If your business collects, changes, transmits, erases, or otherwise uses or stores the personal data of EU citizens, you&rsquo;ll need to comply with the GDPR.</p>
<p>The GDPR has different requirements depending on how you handle customers&rsquo; personal data.</p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;Data Controllers&rdquo; are businesses that collect customer data and also decide how, when and why that customer data is processed. </li>
<li>&ldquo;Data Processors&rdquo; are businesses that carry out the processing of customer data on behalf of a Data Controller.</li>
</ul><p>Vero is both a Data Controller in our capacity as a marketer to our own customers, and a Data Processor as a business that helps other businesses process their customer data.</p>
<h2>Vero&rsquo;s commitment to GDPR compliance &ndash; as a Processor</h2>
<p>In line with our commitment to GDPR compliance, we&rsquo;ve been modifying many of our internal practices and policies to ensure we meet our requirements as a Data Processor on or before the deadline in May 2018.</p>
<p>This process has meant a thorough review of our technical and security practices, internal organizational systems and legal documentation, alongside a review of our own third-party Data Processors to ensure their compliance with the GDPR.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also assessing the impact of the GDPR on our product features and considering if there are any further tools we can build to make implementation more practical for Vero customers who are subject to the GDPR.</p>
<h3>Upcoming changes to support GDPR</h3>
<p>Over the next two months we will be rolling out the following changes:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</strong>. We will release a new DPA that ensures compliance with GDPR in our contractual obligation with you as a customer, including provision for any data transfer to storage outside the EU. This is permitted within the GDPR as long as the correct requirements are met and contractual obligations made.</li>
<li><strong>Updates to our Terms and Privacy</strong>. We&rsquo;ll be making updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to ensure we are fully compliant with the GDPR.</li>
<li><strong>Customer data export</strong> (&ldquo;Right of portability&rdquo;). We&rsquo;ll be providing a way for you to export all data maintained in Vero for a single customer profile so that you can respond to requests from individual customers regarding their personal data.</li>
</ul><h3>Existing ways in which Vero supports GDPR</h3>
<p>We currently offer the following product functions that help us fulfill our role as a Data Processor, and we are reviewing each to ensure we enable you to fully comply with the GDPR in your role as a Data Controller:</p>
<ul><li><strong>&ldquo;Delete&rdquo; requests</strong> (&ldquo;Right to be forgotten&rdquo;). We already provide <code>/delete</code> endpoint on our API. This endpoint removes the customer and all of their data from Vero&rsquo;s systems. We will be extending this endpoint, or introducing a new one, to help ensure that any data sent against a deleted profile is dropped rather than re-tracked.</li>
<li><strong>Updating customer data</strong> (&ldquo;Right to rectification&rdquo;). Calling Vero&rsquo;s <code>/identify</code> API endpoint updates and overrides a customer&rsquo;s user properties, enabling you to respond to customer requests to ensure accuracy in the data you have about them.</li>
<li><strong>Event tracking</strong>. Vero&rsquo;s events enable you to track very granular data about your customers. Ensuring that you track consent given by customers is critical under GDPR and our events will assist in this process. We&rsquo;re reviewing how we can make changes that will enable you to make use of these events efficiently and effectively to support your GDPR compliance.</li>
</ul><h2>Vero&rsquo;s commitment to GDPR compliance &ndash; as a Controller</h2>
<p>As part of our GDPR compliance efforts, we are also ensuring we comply as a Data Controller. In particular, we are ensuring we comply with each of the following key areas:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Right to be forgotten.</strong> You can request to delete your Vero account at any time, and we will ensure that all data about you and your account is deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Right to object and right of access.</strong> We will provide clear information on the ways in which we will use your data for product improvement and marketing, and ensure that we collect the correct consent where required, as well as provide you with mechanisms to opt-out of each type of processing we do. We will be reviewing the customer data we currently have for our customers and ensuring that any extra consent required is collected.</li>
<li><strong>Right to rectification.</strong> You can get in touch with us to have any of your account information updated at any time. Much of this information is already available for you to update via your account Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Right of portability.</strong> We will export your individual account data to a third party at any time upon your request. </li>
</ul><h3>A note on consent</h3>
<p>Under GDPR you must have a legal basis for <strong>all</strong> data processing. As a Data Controller using Vero, it is likely that consent will be the key legal basis used to ensure compliance for the data you send us.</p>
<p>In order to be valid, this consent must be explicit and verifiable.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Verifiable consent</strong> requires a documented, written record of how and when a customer agreed to let you process their data. Vero&rsquo;s events capture the activity and timestamp of a user activity and can form a basis for tracking this consent.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit consent</strong> requires that each contact takes an action to consent to the data being processed. This means they must <strong>actively</strong> tick a box as part of their signup or subscription process and this opt-in process must include a message that clearly (in plain language) states all of the ways in which you can possibly use the personal data you are collecting. A pre-ticked box will not work, as the customer must <em>explicitly</em> opt-in by taking an action. Examples of ways in which you are likely to use data when using Vero and for which you&rsquo;ll require consent could include:
<ul><li>Transferring the user&rsquo;s contact data to Vero</li>
<li>Sending the user email messages using Vero</li>
<li>Tracking behavioural interactions for email marketing purposes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>If you rely on consent to process customers&rsquo; personal data, double check where and why your contacts shared their data with you to make sure that the consent you obtained meets the GDPR&rsquo;s standards.</p>
<h2>How you can prepare yourself for the GDPR</h2>
<p>The first step is to educate yourself on the provisions of the GDPR to understand how they may differ from your current obligations and practices. The best way to do this is to read the GDPR itself. You can find the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">full text here</a>. You can also get details and updates directly from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en">European Commission website</a>.</p>
<p>Another good place to start is to create an up-to-date inventory of personal data that you collect and manage about your customers and where this data is stored, including all third party data processors, such as Vero. Having an understanding of the data you are sending Vero will enable you to ensure that you have consent for the data in question. Remember that historical data also needs to meet the requirements of the GDPR.</p>
<p>You will want to determine if your company needs to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and likely work with a consultant or outside legal representative who is familiar with GDPR and can assist you in your compliance journey.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong> this article provides a resource and does not constitute legal advice: we encourage you to speak to a legal practitioner with the right expertise to learn how GDPR may affect your organization.</em></p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Today we&rsquo;re happy to announce that our new event manager is available to all customers. This whole new Events section in Vero gives you the ability to view and analyze your incoming event data.</p>
<h3>Design email campaigns with placeholder events</h3>
<p>With Vero&rsquo;s event manager, you can use placeholder events to build and test triggered email campaigns before integrating code into your website or application. This offers you a more streamlined process, allowing marketing teams to design personalized customer journeys and then collaborate with engineering to rapidly implement them.</p>
<h3>Test an event and debug automated emails</h3>
<p>You can now simulate user activity by triggering test events for any customer profile in your Vero account. This new testing functionality provides you with full visibility of how user activity triggers your campaigns, giving you complete confidence that your customers will receive the right emails at the right time.</p>
<h3>See which events trigger your campaigns</h3>
<p>Vero&rsquo;s event manager makes it easy for you to view recently fired events and their attached properties to make sure your data reflects the personalization in your emails. You can also see events that are no longer firing and the campaigns they&rsquo;re linked to, helping you debug and troubleshoot campaigns that are not working with greater clarity.</p>
<p>This feature represents our commitment to ensuring your data is transparent and easily accessible in Vero.</p>

<html><body><p>With the redesign of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com" target="_blank">our homepage</a> and the release of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion" target="_blank">Fusion</a> today, we&rsquo;re re-affirming our vision here at Vero to help Product Teams use customer data to create best-in-class email interactions.</p>
<p>Over the coming few months you should see some important updates from us on this blog regarding methodology, product updates and new releases. I invite you to keep up to date with our blog and follow our <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/release-notes" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>, which will be updated every few weeks.</p>
<hr><p>Vero was founded in 2012 and, initially, our focus was on helping marketers use real time customer activity to power automated email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>To begin, we developed a software solution that centred on an API to collect your customer activity via a real time event stream and a UI to create automated email campaigns.</p>
<p>The promise was that simple but powerful API libraries would provide marketing with a rich data stream <strong>without</strong> any real engineering interaction and that Vero&rsquo;s software would enable them to visually create and manage email content, user segments and automated workflows.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the intervening four years. Critically, we&rsquo;ve observed that the organizations who see the <strong>best</strong> results have Product, Engineering and Marketing Teams that <strong>collaborate</strong> to develop high-quality emails. In other words, the <strong>entire</strong> organization is invested in their customers&rsquo; experience of their products. These teams work together closely to ensure that data in and emails out are both accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>For these customers, Vero provides a platform for several or more employees from different teams to <strong>work together</strong> to deploy high quality email experiences: experiences that are heavily data-driven and personalised.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, we want to highlight that Vero is the platform that enables Product, Engineering and Marketing teams to collaborate on product experiences. What we have built today is just the beginning of what we want to build to help teams achieve their goal of providing customers with consistent, personal and valuable experiences of their product(s).</p>
<p>This direction is informed by our vision for Vero: to enable organizations to use their data to deliver products with more utility.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://veropublic.wpengine.com">new homepage</a> brings clarity to this vision and summarises the approach forward-thinking teams are taking to building high quality email experiences &ndash; the approach used by Vero&rsquo;s best customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just getting started. In order to achieve our vision we need to continue to build out tools that help customers achieve:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Data accuracy </strong>&ndash; ensuring complete and accurate data is available for personalisation and modelling, as organizations invest too much time synchronizing and managing the accuracy of their data.</li>
<li><strong>Highly available user models </strong>&ndash; in order to create personalized, valuable product experiences, you have to have data about your customers at the ready, whether they are interacting on-site, in a mobile application or via an email or message.</li>
<li><strong>Efficacious customer interactions, at scale</strong> &ndash; companies are collecting more data and reaching more users than ever before. Ensuring customers have the right experience with accurate data at scale requires a well-defined collaboration and deployment process.</li>
</ul><p>Vero already helps organizations deploy hundreds of millions of valuable email interactions every month and we look forward to working together as we build out the tooling and methodology to help you maintain data accuracy, model your customers and ensure your customer interactions are reliable every time, regardless of your scale.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried Vero before, or if haven&rsquo;t visited it in some time, I invite you to <a href="https://app.getvero.com/signup">create an account</a> and learn more about how we&rsquo;re helping teams collaborate more effectively to deploy more valuable email experiences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking ahead to a fantastic next 12 months &ndash; and can&rsquo;t wait to share updates with you along the way.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>We&rsquo;ve recently been playing with a few new ideas to offer our customers better support.</p>
<p>At Vero, we use <a href="http://helpscout.com">Help Scout</a> to manage our support inbox primarily because we love the look-and-feel of the email responses they send out. We&rsquo;ve used it for nearly three years now and still find it to be well suited to our needs.</p>
<p>At any given time, there are at least two people working on support in a dedicated capacity with a third, typically an engineer, working through technical issues. One challenge we&rsquo;ve had as our team grows and we work with more customers is ensuring <strong>context</strong> is carried from one conversation to the next.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a customer on a free trial. During their trial, they&rsquo;ll receive automated emails from Vero guided by their activity. Have they installed Vero&rsquo;s API? Have they created a campaign? Have they invited team members?</p>
<p>When a free trial customer contacts support, we need to know where they&rsquo;re at in this lifecycle.</p>
<p>There are tools that would let us combine our support and email automation, but we feel these would mean losing out on some of the best features in both Vero and Help Scout.</p>
<p>To make everything fit together, we&rsquo;ve been built two extensions to connect&Acirc;&nbsp;Vero and Help Scout.</p>
<h2>Data at our fingertips</h2>
<p>The first is a custom Help Scout sidebar application we&rsquo;ve crafted. Here&rsquo;s a real example (with the name and email of the customer obscured):</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1-x8_cIje-VCfYB9_sGno8IA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This little sidebar tells us a lot. It tells us whether the customer is paying, when they last interacted with Vero, how engaged they are (that&rsquo;s our homegrown <em>Customer Happiness Index</em> &ndash; above 60 is good), how much they&rsquo;re paying, when they paid, email campaign activity and so on.</p>
<p>In essence, whenever we view a ticket, we look up the user who has emailed in and pull these details from their user profile in Vero (and some data from our own database).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a work in progress, but it&rsquo;s been super useful so far.</p>
<h2>Workflow management</h2>
<p>The second thing we&rsquo;ve crafted is a little tool that has the ability to <em>tag</em> a conversation in Help Scout as the conversation is created or updated. The benefit of this is that we can use Help Scout&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.helpscout.net/article/22-using-workflows" data-href="http://docs.helpscout.net/article/22-using-workflows">Workflows</a> to redirect the message.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how this looks:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1-SRTN4UDDbKG2jKIk2wOWtA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is all automated: the ticket comes in, our system looks up the user and, if they&rsquo;re on a trial, it adds the tag.</p>
<p>We add a bunch of different tags, driven by different rules. The <em>Trial</em> tag is a good example as it allows us to keep tabs on trial tickets and route them to a specific folder. If any tickets are in that folder, the team knows to crush them quickly.</p>
<p>There are two other benefits:</p>
<ol><li>When seeing this tag, we have a good idea what to expect, as most free trial tickets relate to similar questions.</li>
<li>We can pattern-match over time and improve our documentation targeting users in this stage of their lifecycle with Vero.</li>
</ol><h2>More genuine support</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re tweaking these tools as we go, but they provide an interesting glimpse into how we&rsquo;re trying to be more efficient with our support, whilst providing great customer experiences. This is particularly challenging with the complexity of a product like Vero, which has a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>We want to set the benchmark for a great customer experience. These tools give us a better view of the customer, allowing us to create a more genuine and individual customer experience, which is what we&rsquo;re all about here at Vero.</p></body></html>
