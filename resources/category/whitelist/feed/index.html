<html><body><p>This is the second in our series of monthly blog reports. (Check out <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/january-2015/">January&rsquo;s here</a>.)</p>
<p>Most marketers do a combination of email, content, SEO and social. So while most of our readers are interested in email, we recognize learning more about content and SEO is important too. By publishing information about growing the blog, we hope to make it an even more valuable resource.</p>
<p>If you have questions, leave them in the comments. We love to chat marketing.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbers (on the blog subdomain)</strong></p>
<ul><li>Pageviews: 64,918 (+1.64%)</li>
<li>Average time on site: 3:07 (+4.56%)</li>
<li>Bounce rate: 79.60% (+3.51%)</li>
<li>Organic search visits: 15,664 (+14.89%)</li>
<li>New email subscribers: 799</li>
</ul><p><strong>A few other fun facts:</strong></p>
<p>February is three days shorter than January but we still increased pageviews and increased organic visits by nearly 15 percent. If you compare the data from February 1 to March 3 (31 days), we actually earned 71,902 pageviews (+12.57%) and 17,595 organic search visits (+29.05%).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at our organic traffic growth and goals for this year.</p>

</ul><h2>What Worked, What Flopped</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/january-2015/">Last month</a>, I talked a lot about our epic posts (which are killing it). But it&rsquo;s important to reflect on what <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> work.</p>
<p>Here is a challenge most marketers can relate to. At Vero, we create great content a regular basis. Most new posts slow down after about 2,000 pageviews. Once a post hits our normal distribution channels &ndash; our email list, Twitter, Facebook, GrowthHackers, etc. &ndash; we have to create new channels to draw in new readers.</p>
<p>This is a real challenge.</p>
<p>As a marketer, you have to decide where to invest your time. Should you spend more time promoting existing content or write something new? It&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;m constantly asking myself.</p>
<p>This month, we did a great job getting new content out there but we didn&rsquo;t create any new distribution channels. That something I&rsquo;m focusing on in March.</p>
<h2>On Tap for Next Month</h2>
<p>I just got back from SMX West and learned a few keys things we&rsquo;re going to tackle in March and April.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Mobile.</strong> Our site has never been very friendly on mobile devices. We&rsquo;ve already made real progress and we&rsquo;ll continue to make the mobile experience a great one. (On April 21, Google is releasing an <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-search-algorithm-adds-mobile-friendly-factors-app-indexing-ranking-215573">algorithm update</a> that will favor mobile-friendly sites.)</li>
<li><strong>Links.</strong> Like most sites, we get a lot of links from spammy sites. We don&rsquo;t do any black hat SEO, it&rsquo;s just a side effect of publishing a lot of content. We&rsquo;ve never disavowed bad links and we plan to tackle that as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Product updates.</strong> If you&rsquo;ve never used Vero before, you&rsquo;re missing out. It&rsquo;s a robust email tool and we plan to start posting product updates on the blog. The goal isn&rsquo;t to brag about the product, rather to inspire you to use the tools at your disposal to send the best emails you can.</li>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>
<p><span id="more-3554"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/02/27-marketing-tips-thatll-woo-your-visitors-and-win-them-over/" target="_blank">27 Marketing Tips That&rsquo;ll Woo Your Visitors and Win Them Over</a></strong></p>
<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>6. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are looking for tips on creating landing pages that convert like crazy, why not look at one of the most successful companies in the world? Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>

<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances. Cash, points and deals were the top reasons given for being willing to do so, according to the survey.

<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed.

<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Does the location of a CTA within your email make a difference in click rates?</p>
<p>In this study, Canopy Labs compared the performance of CTAs placed in different locations in an email and found that a CTA at the bottom of an email outperformed CTAs placed on the left or right side of an email.</p></blockquote>

<p>A number of studies prove that images in blog posts and social media can increase click-thru rates and sharing. But what about email?</p>
<p>A look at our own data indicated that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/increase-email-click-through-rates/" target="_blank">emails with images had a 42 percent higher click rate</a> than emails without. This list of free image sources, curated by Buffer&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/meet-courtney-seiter/">Courtney Seiter</a>, can be just as useful for your email marketing as it can your content and social media efforts.</p>

<p>Tommy Walker from ConversionXL has a way of articulating complex growth strategies in a way that anyone can understand. He dug through a number of reports and studies to explain exactly how and why businesses should be paying close attention to their onboarding process. There are plenty of examples and action items &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; don&rsquo;t miss this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just so I&rsquo;m clear, when I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Email Onboarding&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not talking about newsletters or batch &amp; blast messaging that asks me to read your latest blog post.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is creating a narrative in the inbox that &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; seamlessly transitions me from &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; by acknowledging how I interact with the stuff you send me and adjusting itself accordingly, made possible by trigger &amp; behavioral based email rules.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>36. <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/your-next-email-subject-line/" target="_blank">4 Hacks You Should Know Before You Craft Your Next Email Subject Line</a></strong></p>
<p>We love hacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that we really liked Zach Bulygo&rsquo;s post on subject line hacks on the KISSmetrics blog. These tips are straightforward, simple and potentially very powerful. Keep this bookmarked for the next time you are struggling with a subject line.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no such thing as the perfect subject line. As a marketer, you need to test your subject lines and see which ones get the most opens. (Now, clearly, getting people to open your email is only one part. After that you need to get them to click or tap on something in the email.) But you&rsquo;ve won half the battle if you can get them to open the email.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>37. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html" target="_blank">What is spam?</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Godin, the father of permission marketing, offers a philosophical explanation of spam. In short, spam destroys trust. Read on to see how to earn trust and keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>38. <a href="http://insideintercom.io/your-number-one-enemy-is-the-back-button/" target="_blank">The back button is your number one enemy</a></strong></p>
<p>I had never heard of the Weigel distribution but it&rsquo;s application to content marketing is spot on. Basically, the longer a visitor stays on your site, the less likely they are to leave. The principle is simple but getting those visitors interested in the first place isn&rsquo;t easy. Nate Munger breaks it down with plenty of examples and tips.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/how-long-stay.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>
<p>If you can keep them for 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re almost as likely to keep them for 2 minutes or more.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>Email is alive and well.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in our minds but this we confirmed our already-strong feelings about the inbox. First, the <em>New York Times</em> covered the resurgence of email newsletters, then we were inundated with positive feedback about our guide to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/transactional-email/">transactional email</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the best articles we read this week. Did we miss something? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p><span id="more-3338"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&acirc;&#128;&#157; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &acirc;&#128;&#156;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &acirc;&#128;&#148; even on this very blog &acirc;&#128;&#148; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &acirc;&#128;&#156;big win&acirc;&#128;&#157; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &acirc;&#128;&#156;with a simple test.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p></blockquote>

<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>

<html><body><p>Why does evergreen content rule? Because we are linking to articles that aren&rsquo;t new but still delivery massive value.</p>
<p>As content creators, it&rsquo;s our goal to create evergreen resources that our readers can learn from for years to come. These articles are all evergreen whether they were published this week or last year. Take note of their content but also their strategy. They must be good if we are linking to them months after publication.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &acirc;&#128;&#156;pattern interrupt,&acirc;&#128;&#157; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &acirc;&#128;&#156;interruption&acirc;&#128;&#157; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is your time better spent writing for your own blog or someone else&rsquo;s? Rand Fishkin calls guest blogging a slippery slope, since you are giving away authority that could be your own. Groove&rsquo;s Alex Turnbull, however, suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>Advice from founders is invaluable, especially when it&rsquo;s really off the beaten path. Beth Belle Cooper asked 10 entrepreneurs for their most counterintuitive advice and uncovered some fascinating insights. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;These days, however, I live without goals, for the most part. It&rsquo;s absolutely liberating, and contrary to what you might have been taught, it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop achieving things.</p>
<p>It means you stop letting yourself be limited by goals.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>Email marketing is really complicated.</p>
<p>You have to write great subject lines and persuasive copy but you won&rsquo;t have anyone to email without great landing pages. And without A/B testing and segmentation, those emails might not perform very well. <strong>The best email marketers put all the pieces together.</strong></p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s Whitelist touches on almost all of these topics, with great examples and in-depth details to help you improve your own marketing.</p>
<p><span id="more-3155"></span></p>
<p>Did we miss a great article? Just let us know in the comments.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.leadpages.net/landing-pages-apple-borrow-apples-best-copywriting-techniques-copy/" target="_blank">Landing Pages by Apple</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for tips on creating landing pages that convert like crazy, why not look at one of the most successful companies in the world? Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &acirc;&#128;&#148; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about craftsmanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about placing you, the customer, squarely in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.qz.com/post/82007790924/how-we-doubled-our-email-sign-up-rate-by-reducing" target="_blank">How we doubled our email sign-up rate by reducing friction</a></strong></p>
<p>This post appeared on Quartz, one of my favorite sites, a few months ago but it&rsquo;s a great reminder that reducing friction is one of the best ways to drive conversions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since we rolled out the new system on February 19, our daily subscriber rate has doubled, even on weekends when activity dips considerably. Users can now sign up via &acirc;&#128;&#156;in-stream units&acirc;&#128;&#157; (pictured above) or through the Daily Brief landing page. Of the people that view that page, a full 60% of them now go on to subscribe. In the chart below, you can see the noticeable effects these small tweaks have made to our growth.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sparksheet.com/secret-social-network-ama-reddits-erik-martin/" target="_blank">The Secret Social Network: AMA with Reddit&rsquo;s Erik Martin</a></strong></p>
<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/4-ways-to-turn-boring-transactional-emails-into-cash/" target="_blank">4 Ways to Turn Boring Transactional Emails into Cash</a></strong></p>
<p>Our CEO Chris Hexton contributed this article to the Unbounce blog this week. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/danlevy" target="_blank">Dan Levy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/amandadurepos" target="_blank">Amanda Durepos</a> for the opportunity and for being so easy to work with.</p>
<blockquote><p>Transactional emails are opened at over twice the rate of promotional and newsletter emails. The reason for this is context. Each of these emails serves a purpose and relates directly to something that your customers have done, meaning that those same customers are much more likely to open them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.lemonstand.com/email-marketing-for-ecommerce/" target="_blank">5 Ways Email Marketing Can Explode Your eCommerce Business</a></strong></p>
<p>It was a busy week here at Vero. I contributed a post to the LemonStand blog. They are a very cool eCommerce platform and together, we crafted some ideas to help eCommerce businesses take advantage of email.</p>
<blockquote><p>An eCommerce business without a robust email marketing strategy is like a defanged python. You simply cannot compete with your competitors if you don&rsquo;t make email a priority.</p>
<p>Email marketing can seem overwhelming, especially when every marketer is also thinking about social media, SEO and content marketing. I&rsquo;m not suggesting you drop those things, but I am suggesting that you take a closer look at how email could explode your business. After all, <strong>91 percent of consumers check their email every single day</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/lean-email-marketing/" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Email: A New Approach Email Marketing</a></strong></p>
<p>Last but not least, take a look at a new way to approach email. We call it lean email marketing, after the now-famous lean startup model popularized by Eric Ries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The product must be both minimal &acirc;&#128;&#148; requiring the least effort to create &acirc;&#128;&#148; and viable &acirc;&#128;&#148; functional enough that users can provide useful feedback. Rather than spending time and money perfecting a product, the lean approach gives entrepreneurs the chance to get rapid feedback, fail fast and improve quickly.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>We talk a lot about writing persuasive copy, segmenting lists and personalization but don&rsquo;t forget that design is extremely important to a successful email marketing strategy.</p>
<p>This week, we pulled together some great articles on how to create your own visuals, where to put them in your emails and how to use existing content to create compelling visual elements. Ready?</p>
<p>If we missed a great story, let us know in the comments.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://unbounce.com/design/17-resources-for-marketers-who-stink-at-design/" target="_blank">17 Battle-Tested Resources for Marketers Who Stink at Design</a></strong></p>
<p>Since marketers don&rsquo;t always have quick access to good designers, it&rsquo;s important to be able to cobble together your own visuals. Luckily, there are some resources that make this <em>really</em> easy. Ritika Puri offers up a list of killer resources in this post.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/compelling-visuals-email-640.png" alt="Create visual content"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/06/13/simple-design-tweaks/" target="_blank">7 Simple Design Tweaks That Send Conversions Through the Roof</a></strong></p>
<p>Good design is important for many reasons, especially conversions. The right colors and images can move readers through a funnel quickly. Bad design can mean lost leads and lost business. Payman Taei breaks it down in this awesome post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to optimizing your website for conversions, visual elements on your page play a huge role. By visual, I mean color, images, cues and their placement on your landing or checkout pages.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/slideshare-best-practices/" target="_blank">SlideShare Best Practices: How to Turn Written Content Into a Winning Deck</a></strong></p>
<p>Because creating compelling visuals isn&rsquo;t easy, it&rsquo;s important for marketers to find easy ways to turn their existing ideas and content into something more shareable and embeddable. Enter SlideShare. It&rsquo;s the YouTube of slideshows and it&rsquo;s a great way to extend the reach of your content marketing.</p>

<p>Data taken from the Econsultancy Email Marketing Census 2014 shows that 68% of companies rate the channel as &acirc;&#128;&#152;good&rsquo; or &acirc;&#128;&#152;excellent&rsquo; for ROI.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of email design is an effective call-to-action, as it needs to inspire recipients into engaging further with your brand.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>You&rsquo;ll increase your chances of success if you follow a century-old formula that marketers and salespeople have been using since the 1900s. I learned it in university 20+ years ago, and it&rsquo;s still being taught and applied today. It&rsquo;s been used for various selling situations, from face-to-face sales presentations to printed sales letters, and now, social media.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>As marketers, we spend a lot of time reading about how to improve our marketing, chatting with others in the community and observing how the best execute their strategies. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the sea of marketing information and actually forget that we should <em>always</em> be thinking about our customers. Always, always, always!</p>
<p>The articles in today&rsquo;s Whitelist address this from different perspectives. A higher open rate, for example, means you are sending better emails. A fast growing list means you are delivering value. Those are customer-centric strategies that can help grow your business.</p>

<p>Are there any great articles we missed? Just let us know in the comments.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/06/05/high-email-open-rates/" target="_blank">3 Tactics You Can Implement Today for Higher Email Open Rates</a></strong></p>
<p>We love the Crazy Egg blog because the content is always in-depth and actionable. This post is no different. George Matthew dives deep into personalization and segmentation, two of our favorite topics.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Personalization is much like a matchmaking exercise with the ultimate goal of pinpointing the best product or service from your catalog that best satisfies your customers&rsquo; needs,&acirc;&#128;&#157; says Scott Brave of Baynote in his whitepaper, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Human Need for Personalization: Psychology, Technology and Science.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>However, according to Scott, that doesn&rsquo;t mean every individual should be sent unique content. There are smart little ways by which you can send personalized emails with the touch of a few keys.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://marketingland.com/survey-showcases-consumer-privacy-paradox-trust-vs-bribes-86483" target="_blank">Trust Vs. Bribes And The Consumer Privacy Paradox</a></strong></p>
<p>How can marketers possibly balance personalization with privacy? Personalization, by its very nature, requires data that consumers are increasingly less willing to give. Unless, of course, they 1) trust the brand or 2) are adequately bribed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances. Cash, points and deals were the top reasons given for being willing to do so, according to the survey. Nonetheless a striking 42 percent said &acirc;&#128;&#156;nothing would motivate me to share personal information with companies.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/email-list-building" target="_blank">Email List-Building From the Experts: How to Grow a Massive Email List</a></strong></p>
<p>Buffer&rsquo;s new content crafter Kevan Lee continues to crush it. In this post, he looks at a few sites, including Help Scout and Andrew Chen&rsquo;s blog, to see how they go about collecting email addresses. The post is loaded with good tips and information, but as Kevan says, it all boils down to great content and calls to action.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/customer-centric-company/" target="_blank">Becoming a Customer Centric Company</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t directly related to email marketing but it&rsquo;s a good reminder that all of our businesses should be entirely focused on a great customer experience. Thanks to KISSMetrics&rsquo; Zach Bulygo for the reminder.</p>
<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed. It&rsquo;s bad news for poorly run companies, as consumers are about twice as likely to share bad customer experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/say-goodbye-to-comfortable/" target="_blank">Say Goodbye to Comfortable Content: How to Make Your Marketing Perform</a></strong></p>
<p>The only way to improve as a marketer, writer and human being is to continually step outside your comfort zone. This post looks at how marketers can make that happen, along with a few action items to maximize your &ldquo;performance.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Have you ever considered that your blog post or email is actually a performance? Think about it: Many people will see and read that post or email. Some will love it, and some might hate it. Still others might be bored by it. The results of your performance are measured in clicks, page views and shares. When you think about it like that, marketing starts to seem really intimidating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get comfortable being uncomfortable.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>The word of the week here at Vero is <strong>insight</strong>. It&rsquo;s a marketing buzzword, we know, but seriously, we learned so much this week about writing killer subject lines, mobile email consumption and landing page optimization. We also learned that it&rsquo;s possible to have an <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/meet-erica-mcgillivray/">open rate above 100 percent</a>.</p>
<p>Rock on, emails marketers. And don&rsquo;t forget to share your favorite email marketing stories in the comments or on <a href="http://twitter.com/veroapp">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2813"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64878-45-words-to-avoid-in-your-email-marketing-subject-lines">45 words to avoid in your email marketing subject lines</a></strong></p>
<p>Christopher Ratcliff from Econsultancy just kills it with this post. He explains which words to stay away from when writing subject lines and why they don&rsquo;t work. Check out the full post for a lot more tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Numbers</h4>
<p>Using numbers may help quantify your message, but constant sales and promotion emails can lead to fatigue. Mix it up as much as you can.</p>
<h4>Tiresome internet slang</h4>
<p>If it hasn&rsquo;t dated already, chances are somewhere and for someone, it already has: LOL, amazeballs, WTF, derp, FTW, epic fail, epic win, cray-cray, totes, adorbs&hellip;</p>
<p>I have so may negative feels towards the above.</p>
<h4>Deceptive familiarity</h4>
<p>FWD: and RE: the artificial adding of &acirc;&#128;&#152;Fwd:&rsquo; or &acirc;&#128;&#152;Re:&rsquo; to trick you into thinking this is part of an ongoing conversation you&rsquo;re engaged with already only creates distrust.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://sparksheet.com/inside-new-york-times-innovation-report/">Inside The New York Times&rsquo; Innovation Report</a></strong></p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> understands how to create compelling content &acirc;&#128;&#148; they have been doing that for more than 150 years &acirc;&#128;&#148; but according to a 96-page leaked document known as the &ldquo;innovation report,&rdquo; the <em>Times</em> is struggling to distribute and monetize that content.</p>
<blockquote><p>A digital-first operation requires a completely reorganized workflow. It means integrating digital teams with editors, allowing data and analytics to inform content decisions, and thinking about how content will look and read on mobile as much as desktop and in print.</p>
<p>Taking a look at its competitors, the authors note that it&rsquo;s this focus on &acirc;&#128;&#156;the dry stuff &ndash; tools, workflow and process&acirc;&#128;&#157; that has resulted in BuzzFeed&rsquo;s explosive growth. Rather than relying on quality journalism to market itself, getting content to lots of people requires baking business interests into the product from the get-go.</p></blockquote>
<p>This post veers off our normal email beat, but it does a good job of summarizing the incredibly deep and interesting report. We encourage you to give it a read.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://moz.com/blog/most-entertaining-guide-to-landing-page-optimization">The Most Entertaining Guide to Landing Page Optimization You&rsquo;ll Ever Read</a></strong></p>
<p>This post <em>actually</em> lives up to the billing. Take the table of content as an accurate prelude to what you&rsquo;ll get in this massive post from Oli Gardner (Unbounce co-founder) on the Moz blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>First I&rsquo;ll give you the only rationale you&rsquo;ll ever need to explain why landing pages are to marketers, what Immodium is to an astronaut with diarrhea. Essential.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll prove why context &ndash; not content &ndash; is king when it comes to conversion.</li>
<li>Following that, I will make you fall in love with forms. FYI, it&rsquo;s really, really hard to make form love a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Mid way through we&rsquo;ll sip some Canadian Club, get our Don Draper on, and learn how to write copy like the Mad Men (and Women).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Paint me a pretty picture Johnny!&rdquo; &ldquo;Screw you mommy. Design is not just rainbows and unicorns!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Is it greedy to want a second helping when you&rsquo;re an orphan? Not if you have my name. (It&rsquo;s Oliver in case you&rsquo;re confused).</li>
<li>Always ask for more when it comes to conversion .And finally, I&rsquo;ll put my art critic hat on and rip into some landing page examples, both good and bad.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/the-email-marketers-checklist/">The Email Marketer&rsquo;s Checklist: 9 Questions to Ask Before You Hit Send</a></strong></p>
<p>This post is a beast at 2,300 words but it&rsquo;s loaded with ideas to make your emails smarter and more effective. Have you ever, for example, who your email is <em>really</em> from?</p>
<blockquote><p>Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email really from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &acirc;&#128;&#156;from&acirc;&#128;&#157; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lots more where that came from.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/guides/email-marketing-trends/">Email interaction across mobile and desktop</a></strong></p>
<p>Did you know that more people open emails on mobile devices but far fewer actually click? And are you familiar with email &ldquo;triage&rdquo;? This report from Campaign Monitor is loaded with insights about mobile email.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Two weeks ago, we started a weekly content roundup known as The Whitelist, and we already missed a week!</p>
<p>I was out in beautiful Denver, Colorado at the first annual Copyblogger Authority conference (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/authority-intensive-2014/">read a recap here</a>) meeting new people and learning <em>tons</em> about great marketing. I&rsquo;ll be including tips and tricks that I learned in some of our upcoming posts so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some excellent posts have been written by our favorite bloggers and they deserve to highlighted. Here are some of our favorite posts from the past week. Conversion is a central theme and these posts will open your mind to new ideas for converting readers to subscribers and leads to customers.</p>
<p>Is there something great we missed? Just let us know in the comments or on <a href="https://twitter.com/veroapp">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2732"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/05/14/analytic-approach/" target="_blank">How to Find and Fix Conversion Problems</a></strong></p>
<p>Longform content has to be really, really good in order to keep our attention, and The Daily Egg does it right. This 1,500-word post, which is the fifth in a five part series, covers testing landing pages from top to bottom.</p>
<blockquote><p>To optimize anything, you need to conduct a scientific experiment, carefully analyze the results, select the optimal result, and repeat. If everything is done correctly, the results get better and better over time.</p>
<p>This concept applies very nicely to website design.</p>
<p>A good website design is one that delivers consistently high conversion rates. But even the best websites can increase conversions. You simply need to know how.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://qz.com/209950/the-homepage-is-dead-and-the-social-web-has-won-even-at-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">The homepage is dead, and the social web has won</a></strong></p>
<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends. In addition to social media, email is one of the main reasons that home pages receive less traffic than ever. Rather than going looking for news and content, people get it delivered to them. Just one more reason to spend extra time developing <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-increase-revenue-34-percent/" target="_blank">strategic email newsletters</a>.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/homepage-is-dead-vero-640.png" alt="The Homepage is Dead"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://copyhackers.com/2012/11/how-to-find-and-eliminate-friction-words-in-your-web-copy/" target="_blank">How to Find and Eliminate &acirc;&#128;&#156;Friction Words&acirc;&#128;&#157; in Your Web Copy</a></strong></p>
<p>This post is more than a year old but after hearing Joanna speak at the Authority conference, I felt it was important to share. She breaks down which words are great for conversion and which words should be avoided at all costs. It&rsquo;s a great read.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friction words are words that describe things people <em>have</em> to do &ndash; not things people <em>want</em> to do. They cause cognitive friction. Web copy that converts is focused on what people <em>want</em> to do.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64822-can-win-back-email-campaigns-help-reactivate-lapsed-customers">Can win-back email campaigns help reactivate lapsed customers?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &acirc;&#128;&#152;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">4 Tips for Killer Calls to Action in Your Emails</a></strong></p>
<p>The fabulous Lexi Rodrigo wrote this post for the Vero blog this week. It&rsquo;s loaded with great information &acirc;&#128;&#148; backed by studies, reports and surveys &acirc;&#128;&#148; about how to craft a perfect sales pitch in your emails. Read the full article for more gems like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the location of a CTA within your email make a difference in click rates?</p>
<p>In this study, Canopy Labs compared the performance of CTAs placed in different locations in an email and found that a CTA at the bottom of an email outperformed CTAs placed on the left or right side of an email.</p></blockquote>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/click-rates-2-640.png" alt="How to increase click-thru rates"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/free-image-sources-list" target="_blank">53+ Free Image Sources For Your Blog and Social Media Posts</a></strong></p>
<p>A number of studies prove that images in blog posts and social media can increase click-thru rates and sharing. But what about email?</p>
<p>A look at our own data indicated that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/increase-email-click-through-rates/" target="_blank">emails with images had a 42 percent higher click rate</a> than emails without. This list of free image sources, curated by Buffer&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/meet-courtney-seiter/">Courtney Seiter</a>, can be just as useful for your email marketing as it can your content and social media efforts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly every image created in the last 30 years is still protected by copyright&acirc;&#128;&#148;a protection that gives virtually every author the exclusive right to use or reproduce their work. But you can find a public domain photo, use a Creative Commons image that might need attribution or even create your own image from scratch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll explore all of these and then some in this post about free image sources.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>Welcome to <strong>The Whitelist</strong>, our brand new weekly roundup of articles, case studies, tweets, reports and news. Many (but not all) of the content we share here will come from <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/">these 50 blogs</a>. Our goal is to curate the best, the most interesting and the most insightful content on email marketing. We are reading it anyway, so why not share it with our readers?</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy, and let us know if you think there is a post we should share next week.</p>
<p><span id="more-2664"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://conversionxl.com/onboarding-emails/" target="_blank">Onboarding Emails: What Happens After They Sign Up For Your &acirc;&#128;&#156;Free Thing&acirc;&#128;&#157;</a></strong></p>
<p>Tommy Walker from ConversionXL has a way of articulating complex growth strategies in a way that anyone can understand. He dug through a number of reports and studies to explain exactly how and why businesses should be paying close attention to their onboarding process. There are plenty of examples and action items &hellip; don&rsquo;t miss this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just so I&rsquo;m clear, when I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Email Onboarding&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not talking about newsletters or batch &amp; blast messaging that asks me to read your latest blog post.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is creating a narrative in the inbox that &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; seamlessly transitions me from &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; by acknowledging how I interact with the stuff you send me and adjusting itself accordingly, made possible by trigger &amp; behavioral based email rules.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/your-next-email-subject-line/" target="_blank">4 Hacks You Should Know Before You Craft Your Next Email Subject Line</a></strong></p>
<p>We love hacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that we really liked Zach Bulygo&rsquo;s post on subject line hacks on the KISSmetrics blog. These tips are straightforward, simple and potentially very powerful. Keep this bookmarked for the next time you are struggling with a subject line.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no such thing as the perfect subject line. As a marketer, you need to test your subject lines and see which ones get the most opens. (Now, clearly, getting people to open your email is only one part. After that you need to get them to click or tap on something in the email.) But you&rsquo;ve won half the battle if you can get them to open the email.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html" target="_blank">What is spam?</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Godin, the father of permission marketing, offers a philosophical explanation of spam. In short, spam destroys trust. Read on to see how to earn trust and keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://insideintercom.io/your-number-one-enemy-is-the-back-button/" target="_blank">The back button is your number one enemy</a></strong></p>
<p>I had never heard of the Weigel distribution but it&rsquo;s application to content marketing is spot on. Basically, the longer a visitor stays on your site, the less likely they are to leave. The principle is simple but getting those visitors interested in the first place isn&rsquo;t easy. Nate Munger breaks it down with plenty of examples and tips.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/how-long-stay.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>
<p>If you can keep them for 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re almost as likely to keep them for 2 minutes or more.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://moz.com/blog/the-greatest-misconception-in-content-marketing-whiteboard-friday" target="_blank">The Greatest Misconception in Content Marketing </a></strong></p>
<p>The latest Whiteboard Friday video from Rand Fishkin touches on <em>so many</em> of the challenges that content marketers face. It&rsquo;s ten minutes well spent.</p>
