<html><body><p class="lead">Data-driven marketing can be sophisticated, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be complex.</p>
<p>Email is a medium that tends to get overcomplicated. It&rsquo;s understandable &ndash; most marketers are managing more than one email tool, dozens of lists of thousands of users. But there is some good news about email personalization &ndash; it&rsquo;s more straightforward than you think. In fact, there are really only three ways to personalize an email. I&rsquo;ll go over each, with a few examples and more detail in this post.</p>
<h2>Personalize with Content</h2>
<p>This is the first and most obvious way to personalize an email. Your goal is to get as close to 1-to-1 messaging as possible. There are a few ways to achieve this.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to gloss over the finer details since <a href="/resources/dynamic-content">we just wrote about this last week</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Basic segmentation</strong></p>
<p>This applies mostly to newsletters. By making it very clear who the email is for, you are essentially segmenting the list. <a href="https://iosdevweekly.com/">iOS Dev Weekly</a> is a good example &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way the wrong people end up on this list, so the content is at least broadly personalized.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Tags</strong></p>
<p>These placeholders are replaced by names, usernames, birthdays and other basic user data at send time.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>Hey {{user.name}}!</code> becomes &ldquo;Hey Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can also use Liquid templates to get more sophisticated. For example, you can use Liquid to pull any user data from Vero into an email.</p>
<p><strong>External Attributes</strong></p>
<p>This is the bread and butter of the world&rsquo;s best email marketers. External attributes is a Vero feature that pulls data from an external API into your emails. If you want to suggest products, send contextual retention emails or capture abandoned carts, this is how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p><a href="/resources/dynamic-content">Read more on content personalization.</a></p>
<h2>Personalize with Timing</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of email, there are two ways to optimize the time an email arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve already segmented by user interest, the next step is identifying the optimal time to send your message. This is done by testing days of the week and time of day. This is common practice but there&rsquo;s a forgotten variable that most marketers overlook: time zones.</p>
<p>Prioritizing your most popular time zone is a mistake. What about the people in other time zones? If a segment responds well to a newsletter at 10am on Tuesday, you can ensure <em>everyone</em> receives it then with our timezone management feature.</p>

<p><a href="/resources/time-zone-management">Read more on time zone management.</a></p>
<p><strong>Lifecycle/Behavioral Emails</strong></p>
<p>Emails that are sent as part of campaign rely on timing as well. While time of the day/week is important, the user&rsquo;s place in the <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a> is more important.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t send an email asking a customer to write a review until they&rsquo;ve had a chance to use your product. Amazon, for example, triggers an event when you finish a Kindle book. They use that to send the email that asks you to review it. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of sending an email at the right moment.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="468px"><img data-attachment-id="7339" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/personalize-your-email/vero-dynamic-segment-example/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?fit=468%2C246&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="468,246" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero dynamic segment example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?fit=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?fit=468%2C246&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7339" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png" alt="vero dynamic segment example" width="468" height="246" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></p>
<p>Event tracking and segmentation is the best way to achieve this. By pushing customer data into Vero, you can ensure users only the receive emails that are contextual and relevant to their</p>

<p>Personalize with Segments<br>
Once you say goodbye to lists, personalization gets so much easier.</p>
<p>Segments are sets of users grouped by condition. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Customers that are tagged with VIP</li>
<li>Customers that haven&rsquo;t tried feature X</li>
<li>Blog subscribers that have read at least two articles</li>
<li>Users who played Level 1 but not Level 2</li>
<li>Customers who signed in with Facebook</li>
</ul><p>The list goes on and on. Here&rsquo;s what the segment builder looks like in Vero:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7346" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/personalize-your-email/vero-segments/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?fit=736%2C309&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="736,309" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="vero segments" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?fit=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?fit=736%2C309&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg" alt="vero segments" width="736" height="309" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?w=736&amp;ssl=1 736w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flexible and powerful. Segments are the core of our email tool because it&rsquo;s by far the best way to group users. Plus, they update in real-time. SO if a user no longer meets the conditions, they are removed.</p>

<h3>The Perfect Email</h3>
<p>Once you stop thinking about &ldquo;blasting&rdquo; your users and start thinking about getting as close to 1-to-1 personalization as possible, email becomes much more powerful. The companies that treat email like an extension of their product and not a marketing channel excel at email. And their users reward them for it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p class="lead">For all the talk of personalization in email marketing, there&rsquo;s little discussion about dynamic content. Marketers have been inserting basic customer metadata &ndash; names, ages, cities, etc. &ndash; for years, but that&rsquo;s personalization 101. It&rsquo;s time to turn it up a notch.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve spent the last three years building tools to help you insert new kinds of dynamic data into your emails. Tracking on-site and in-app activity is just the beginning. Once the data is tracked &ndash; think product views, feature usage, inactivity &ndash; you can actually insert content based on user behavior. You can, for example, <a href="/resources/the-retention-email/">send reminders based on products viewed</a> or suggest new products to regular customers.</p>
<p>In the past, this would have required massaging your data with SQL and multiple CSV exports/imports. But now, you can insert literally any of your data into emails from a single interface. That includes the basics, like user names and roles, but also product images, inventory, links and so much more.</p>
<p>Dynamic content has arrived. Soon, static content will be the exception, replaced by APIs sending in the best possible content as your emails hit the inbox. In this post, we&rsquo;ll explain the tiers of content personalization and how to achieve each.</p>
<h2>Tiers of Personalized Email Content</h2>
<p>Making an email great for a user to receive translates into something great for you. So what makes an email great?</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>Great for the customer</strong></th>
<th><strong>What it means for you</strong></th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Solving a problem</td>
<td>Conversions</td>
</tr><tr><td>Sharing interesting/valuable information</td>
<td>Engagement</td>
</tr><tr><td>Making the recipient smile</td>
<td>Retention</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>Personalized content is essential in order to provide contextual content that triggers the human emotions required to click, read, subscribe and buy. But too much email content is one-dimensional. Typing an article or sales copy into an HTML template and clicking &ldquo;Send&rdquo; has become the unfortunate norm.</p>
<h3>Level 0: Segments and Static Content</h3>
<p>Subscribing to a newsletter is a broad form of personalization. When someone subscribes, they are essentially segmenting themselves according to interest. If the content is as interesting as expected, your emails should have high engagement. We&rsquo;re referring to this as Level 0 because it&rsquo;s the baseline for any good campaign.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="587px"><img data-attachment-id="7318" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/buzzfeed-animals/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buzzfeed-animals.png?fit=587%2C417&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="587,417" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="buzzfeed animals" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buzzfeed-animals.png?fit=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buzzfeed-animals.png?fit=587%2C417&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7318" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buzzfeed-animals.png" alt="buzzfeed animals" width="587" height="417" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buzzfeed-animals.png?w=587&amp;ssl=1 587w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buzzfeed-animals.png?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tools/email/animals">BuzzFeed Animals newsletter</a> is a perfect example. They tell you the segment you are entering before you sign-up. As an added bonus, they also tell you when to expect it. (Context for the win!) This might seem cheeky but it&rsquo;s actually brilliant. It&rsquo;s impossible for the wrong people end up on this list. This isn&rsquo;t advanced but it is highly effective. Done well, it can help you build trusting relationships with your users.</p>
<p>You can double down on this by collecting subscribers&rsquo; time zones based on their IP address, then send the newsletter at an optimal time in their location. <a href="/resources/time-zone-management">Read way more on time zone management here.</a></p>
<h3>Level 1: Insert Basic Customer Merge Tags</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve definitely received emails with your name in the subject line &ndash; as email marketers, we all know that merge tags at work. Merge tags are placeholders that are replaced by actual content when the email is sent.</p>
<p><code>Hey {{user.name}}!</code></p>
<p>&hellip;becomes&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7319" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/rge-merge-tags/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RGE-merge-tags.jpg?fit=796%2C430&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="796,430" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="RGE merge tags" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RGE-merge-tags.jpg?fit=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RGE-merge-tags.jpg?fit=796%2C430&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7319" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RGE-merge-tags.jpg" alt="RGE merge tags" width="796" height="430" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RGE-merge-tags.jpg?w=796&amp;ssl=1 796w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RGE-merge-tags.jpg?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px"></p>
<p>This data is primarily collected on signup and stored in your email service provider&rsquo;s database. Like Level 0, it&rsquo;s not advanced but it&rsquo;s a step closer to one-to-one email marketing.</p>
<h3>Level 2: Collect and Insert On-Site Data</h3>
<p>At Vero, we use the <a href="http://help.getvero.com/articles/inserting-merge-tags-using-liquid-in-my-emails.html">Liquid Templating language</a> to handle merge tags. This is a powerful tool for merge tags that allows you to do equations, create <code>if</code> blocks and loop through data.</p>
<p>We track two things that can be used in Liquid: users and events. Each of these can have all kinds of attached properties &ndash; timestamps, URL strings, product data, etc. &ndash; that can also be used for personalization. If a user or event is a noun, properties are the adjectives that describe them.</p>
<p>Using our API, you can track <em>any</em> events you like with <em>any</em> properties you like in real-time as users browse your site, app or store. Here are a few typical event properties you can only capture in this way:</p>
<ul><li>Products in cart (array)</li>
<li>Creation of a project or other item in your SaaS app and their details</li>
<li>Product views, including their categories</li>
<li>Password resets and the temporary token that powers that reset</li>
</ul><p>Abandoned cart emails are a good example of using this on-site activity. An event is tracked &ndash; <em>Viewed Cart</em> &ndash; with an event attribute that is an array of all the items in their cart &ndash; including, for example, a <em>6&Prime; Service Boot</em>. You can use the event to trigger the email &ndash; <em>Send after 24 hours of inactivity</em> &ndash; and use the event attribute to populate the product field. You can even use the product image (another event property) in the email.</p>

<p>You can push all kinds of data into Vero for future personalization. Here are two more examples:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Tag your content based on its primary goal, then push the data into Vero</strong>. For example, we tag each post with a target job (acquisition, nurture, retention) and target persona (B2C, B2B, e-commerce, marketing), then push the data into Vero. From there, we can create segments based on each readers&rsquo; industry and place in the customer lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Track events in-app, then trigger emails with event properties.</strong> Imagine you&rsquo;re Twitter and you want people to tweet more. You can track an event when users start a tweet and another when then send it. When a user takes the first behavior without the second, you can trigger an email reminder that includes the text of the tweet.</li>
</ol><p>By pushing data into Vero, you keep one central record for each user which can be used to segment users and personalize emails. This is fairly sophisticated, but there&rsquo;s still another level of personalization.</p>
<h3>Level 3: Pull Data From Your Own Database</h3>
<p>There are situations where the data you want to insert into an email changes in the period since it was tracked, or is not available in real-time as the customer browses your site.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Level 3 comes in, and it&rsquo;s a game-changer. By connecting external APIs to Vero, you can take email personalization to a new level. To explain how it works, I&rsquo;ll use a real customer example.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uniplaces.com/">Uniplaces</a> is a marketplace for students to book accommodations and for landlords to find tenants. When users sign up and begin searching for a house or apartment, Uniplaces tracks events and event properties that allow them to send impressive email campaigns.</p>
<p>When a logged-in user views a listing, they record an event &ndash; <em>Views listing</em> &ndash; and an event property &ndash; <em>event.city</em>. If the user fails to complete the next event &ndash; <em>Completes booking</em> &ndash; Uniplaces sends an email with suggested listings.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of that email:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7321" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/preview-as-user/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/preview-as-user.png?fit=698%2C687&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="698,687" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="uniplaces personalized email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/preview-as-user.png?fit=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/preview-as-user.png?fit=698%2C687&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7321" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/preview-as-user.png" alt="uniplaces personalized email" width="698" height="687" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/preview-as-user.png?w=698&amp;ssl=1 698w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/preview-as-user.png?resize=300%2C295&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px"></p>
<p>The four links to suggested apartments in the user&rsquo;s target city are inserted dynamically. Uniplaces only has to create this email once. Then, regardless of the city, the email will be personalized with relevant listings. One event, one template, one campaign and one database of suggested listings.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s obviously some wizardry going on behind the scenes, but it&rsquo;s not overly complex. In this case, the first step is creating an API endpoint to load the suggested listings. This data lives outside of Vero, but can be inserted via Liquid in the campaign creator. The &ldquo;External Attributes&rdquo; field connects any outside data to your emails.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7322" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/dynamic-content/campaign-setup/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/campaign-setup.png?fit=888%2C524&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="888,524" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="uniplaces-campaign-setup" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/campaign-setup.png?fit=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/campaign-setup.png?fit=888%2C524&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7322" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/campaign-setup.png" alt="uniplaces-campaign-setup" width="888" height="524" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/campaign-setup.png?w=888&amp;ssl=1 888w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/campaign-setup.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px"></p>
<p>Each item is an array that can be inserted when the user attribute matches the target city. For example, if the user attribute is <em>user.Porto</em>, Vero pulls the Porto array into the email. (This code is just a sample of the many cities in the array.)</p>
<pre>{"data":
[
{
"city": "PT-lisbon",
"listing_EN_1": "https://www.uniplaces.com/accommodation/city/11990",
"title_EN_1": "Cheerful single bedroom in Campolide",
"listing_EN_2": "https://www.uniplaces.com/accommodation/city/18048",

},
{
"city": "PT-porto",
"listing_EN_1": "https://www.uniplaces.com/accommodation/city/6837",
"title_EN_1": "Single bedroom in 5-bedroom house with a terrace in Pedrou\\\\u00e7os",
"listing_EN_2": "https://www.uniplaces.com/accommodation/city/21536",

"listing_EN_4": "https://www.uniplaces.com/accommodation/city/26578",
"title_EN_4": "Cosy double bedroom near quiet Rechousa"
}
]
}</pre>
<p>Next, Uniplaces tells Vero where to insert the external content. A bit of code explains the conditions that dictate the eventual content.</p>
<pre>{%for entry in external.data%}
{%if entry.city == user.destination_city%}
{% capture listing_1 %}{{entry.listing_EN_1}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture title_1 %}{{entry.title_EN_1}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture listing_2 %}{{entry.listing_EN_2}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture title_2 %}{{entry.title_EN_2}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture listing_3 %}{{entry.listing_EN_3}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture title_3 %}{{entry.title_EN_3}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture listing_4 %}{{entry.listing_EN_4}}{% endcapture %}
{% capture title_4 %}{{entry.title_EN_4}}{% endcapture %}
{%endif%}
{%endfor%}</pre>
<p>Then, they insert placeholders in the email HTML.</p>
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{listing_1}}"&gt;{{title_1}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{listing_2}}"&gt;{{title_2}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="{{listing_3}}"&gt;{{title_3}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<p>When the email is sent, Vero filters through the API endpoint to match the right content to each individual user. Pairing existing metadata with targeted content creates an email experience that is more relevant and useful to your users.</p>

<html><body><p class="lead">Your customers are inundated with hundreds of messages every day. The signal to noise ratio is lower than ever.</p>
<p>But somehow, a handful of businesses manage to stand out in the inbox. Some rely on data to monitor behavior and trigger messages. Others invest in good, old-fashioned branding. Still others make their mark with great copywriting. There is no <em>right</em> way but there are plenty of wrong ones.</p>
<p>Regardless of your approach &ndash; and all three can work in any industry &ndash; there&rsquo;s a fine line between emails that improve your customers&rsquo; experience and emails that hurt it.</p>
<p>Take Zazzle for example. A few months back, <a href="/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/" target="_blank">we wrote about their excellent shipping confirmation email</a>. The experience started off on the right foot but it&rsquo;s since devolved into an endless series of coupons and limited offers. (For the uninitiated, Zazzle is a platform that lets you customize t-shirts, mugs, hats and just about anything else. It&rsquo;s also a platform for makers and artists to sell their products. <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/about" target="_blank">And they use robots for all their product photography.</a>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received 243 emails in the 251 days since my first (and only) purchase.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7070" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="831,244" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7070" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png" alt="zazzle emails" width="831" height="244" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?w=831&amp;ssl=1 831w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px"></p>
<p>I had a great experience on their site but now, I&rsquo;m flooded with offers for everything from throw pillows to smartphone cases. The emails look great and the copy is sharp, but the overall effect is hurtful. Zazzle has commoditized their brand.</p>
<h2>How Zazzle Could Improve Their Email Strategy</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for an outsider to offer blanket advice like &ldquo;send less email.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vero CEO Chris Hexton offered an interesting perspective. &ldquo;If this gets results for Zazzle, should they send fewer emails?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If a key driver of their business model is these daily deals, then perhaps this strategy could be working very well. Maybe it really is the best approach for them. &rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is it <em>has</em> worked well.</p>
<p>Zazzle <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">netted around $250 million</a> in FY2015, a 25 percent increase over 2014. &ldquo;Just because we don&rsquo;t love the business model doesn&rsquo;t mean we can hate on the strategy,&rdquo; Chris reminded me.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">CNBC profile</a> emphasized that Zazzle is &ldquo;doing something crazy by Silicon Valley standards: generating profit.&rdquo; No e-commerce company &ndash; except, perhaps, Amazon &ndash; can afford to forgo profits while they build a platform, audience or brand. Whatever Zazzle is doing clearly works.</p>
<p>That said, daily &ldquo;spray and pray&rdquo; emails aren&rsquo;t always the best way to appeal to customers. We like Zazzle and we&rsquo;re fans of businesses actually pursuing revenue. So we pose this question: <strong>How can Zazzle send fewer emails and make more money?</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>
<h3>Ask for more customer information and use it.</h3>
<p>I went digging around my Zazzle account and found that you can complete a profile. This information is the key to better marketing. But I&rsquo;ve never been asked to fill it out.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="276px"><img data-attachment-id="7091" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-profile/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="276,291" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle profile" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7091" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png" alt="zazzle profile" width="276" height="291"></p>
<p>I made my first purchase on Zazzle because I wanted a custom t-shirt. They delivered and I was a happy customer. But a few days after the order shipped, the onslaught of emails began. I immediately (and subconsciously) started ignoring their marketing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smart to capitalize on the momentum of a first purchase. Instead of telling new customers about the next sale, what if Zazzle offered $5 off the next purchase in exchange for a completed profile? That would give them access to gender, location, age, social profiles and more.</p>
<p>Data like this unlocks an opportunity for better email.</p>

<p>Lots of SaaS companies, like Twitter, use sign-up momentum to collect basic demographic data. E-commerce businesses like Zazzle can borrow inspiration from their SaaS peers.</p>

<p>Pinterest users might be interested in their <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">Pinterest boards</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t one-to-one email marketing but it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. Personalized offers are more compelling than exclusive discounts and weekend sales. The more Zazzle gets to know their customers, the more focused their marketing can be.</p>
<p>Imagine how nice it would be to surprise customers with relevant emails instead of hammering them with offers.</p>
<h3>Automate follow-up emails based on behavior.</h3>
<p><a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">Inactivity and retention emails</a> are the bread and butter of most SaaS email campaigns. Without recurring subscription revenue, e-commerce businesses need to spend even more time thinking about customer retention.</p>
<p>There are <a href="/resources/triggered-retention-emails/">three different types of inactivity</a>: initial, partial and complete. The relationship begins with an event like a purchase or email signup and customers should receive different types of emails based on how long they&rsquo;ve been inactive.</p>
<p>In each case, behavioral emails work well because campaigns can start or stop depending the customers&rsquo; activity (or lack thereof). Here are examples of each.</p>
<p><strong>Initial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>A customer makes a purchase but doesn&rsquo;t view any additional products within two weeks. Go for the small win by asking them to follow you on Pinterest, write a product review, check out related products or see curated products on a blog.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7168" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/airbnb-curated-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="693,855" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="airbnb curated email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7168" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg" alt="airbnb curated email" width="693" height="855" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?w=693&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"></p>
<p>Airbnb is a good example. They curate popular listings for inactive customers.</p>
<p>If customers show interest in a listing, <a href="/resources/the-retention-email/">Airbnb sends specific follow-up emails</a>. Everything here is automated. The curated emails generate activity, which can be used to send more targeted messages.</p>
<p><strong>Partial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>As time passes without a repeat purchase, emails tend include more urgency and deeper discounts. That&rsquo;s one way to do it. But with more data, it&rsquo;s easy to send targeted emails.</p>

<p>Take ProFlowers for example. Knowing that most customers are buying gifts, they send these helpful reminders. I hadn&rsquo;t used ProFlowers in a year but upon receipt of this email, made another purchase. This is called a <a href="/resources/replenishment-email/">replenishment email</a> and it&rsquo;s one of the most under-utilized forms of e-commerce marketing.</p>
<p>Product updates are another way to engage partially inactive customers. If something new or exciting has happened since the customer last visited your site, let them know via email.</p>

<p>You can try a &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; email to make a really compelling offer.</p>
<p>Remember though &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve toned down the frequency of your marketing emails, &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; emails stand out. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re just another email that gets lost in the mix.</p>
<h3>Use content, not products, to drive engagement.</h3>
<p>Evernote has a problem. Their software is a blank slate. It can be used for so many things but every new customer starts at the same place: square one.</p>
<p>Zazzle has a similar problem. Because customers can customize products, the possibilities are endless. This is where content can provide inspiration. Evernote uses case studies and product updates to show users how to use their software. Zazzle does a bit of this <a href="http://blog.zazzle.com/2015/10/06/3-killer-halloween-party-themes-decor-ideas/">on their blog</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">on Pinterest</a> but it&rsquo;s hidden in the footers of their emails.</p>

<p>Mixing content into Zazzle&rsquo;s email flow would break up the monotony of the sales-heavy emails and engage customers in a new way. Content also supports social media engagement and discovery. For e-commerce companies, it&rsquo;s part of a balanced marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing we believe in at Vero, it&rsquo;s quality. Our email software is designed to make segmentation, personalization and automation happen. Instead of hacking a few different tools together to send the campaigns you know will appeal to customers, use Vero do it all in one place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Email isn&rsquo;t the only way to retain customers but it&rsquo;s low-hanging fruit for most businesses.</p>
<p>While most customers stay for a great product and exceptional customer service, you must acknowledge that some churn is caused simply by apathy. Most of your customers don&rsquo;t have time, or simply don&rsquo;t care enough, to squeeze every last drop of value from your product. Even the best products have features that are lightly used, and customers who forget why they signed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Your product team is constantly improving the product &ndash; that is the core of retention &ndash; but the marketing team has something to offer too: <strong>communication</strong>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where retention emails come in. These are emails designed to get customers more engaged, whether they are totally inactive or just not taking full advantage of your product. If you fear that your customers aren&rsquo;t getting value for their money, retention emails are a great way to show them what they&rsquo;re missing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pulled 15 great retention emails from my own inbox. Some are true retention emails in the sense that I abandoned a product and they are trying to bring me back, while others are lifecycle emails trying to draw my attention to features, products or events I&rsquo;m missing out on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m labeling them all as retention emails because they &hellip;</p>
<ul><li>Are automated as part of a drip campaign;</li>
<li>Are triggered as a result of behavior (or lack of behavior);</li>
<li>Encourage me to get more engaged, or;</li>
<li>Notify me of features, deals or events I would have otherwise missed.</li>
</ul><p>Newsletters can accomplish some of the same objectives but they aren&rsquo;t automated. Email blasts could let people know about upcoming events but they aren&rsquo;t triggered. All true retention emails are <strong>smart</strong> &ndash; they are sent only to the people that need them, when they need them.</p>
<h2>Targeting Users in Limbo</h2>
<p>How do you know if users are at risk of churn?</p>
<p>Look for users in limbo. Users in limbo have completed one or more important actions &ndash; i.e. they signed up or created an account &ndash; but haven&rsquo;t made the jump to happy customer. They might be stuck in a freemium plan, let a free trial lapse or even forgot they were paying for your product.</p>

<p>After the initial <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a>, onboarding emails are used to get new users acquainted and active. If those don&rsquo;t work, retention emails can be used to communicate. The goal is to turn new users into happy customers, then use <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecyle emails</a> to keep them engaged.</p>
<p>These examples are highly practical and actionable, and meant specifically for users in limbo. I&rsquo;ll address the merits of each individually. You can <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/runjimdaly/retentionemails" target="_blank">add them to your Evernote account</a> for inspiration later on.</p>
<h2>Calm: Stress-Free Design</h2>
<p>The line between newsletters and retention emails can be blurry. That is especially true here. Calm&rsquo;s email could easily have been sent to their entire userbase but I suspect they targeted me because I downloaded the mobile app and didn&rsquo;t complete the initial seven-day meditation program. They likely recognize my interest and are trying to encourage me to try a new meditation. Something fresh and different might stick, and that could lead to a new paying customer.</p>
<p>This email has more white space than most, and for good reason. A 2011 <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/hspr/research/ciemh/mhn/projects/litreview/LitRevAgg.pdf">study</a> by the Institute of Psychiatry and Kings College London examined aggressive behavior by mentally ill patients in hospitals. They found that violent incidents dropped on weekends, when they hospitals were quieter and less chaotic.</p>
<p>Roger S. Ulrich, Ph.D., an expert in architecture and healthcare design, wrote about the study in the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/building-a-space-for-calm.html?_r=0">New York Times</a></em>, emphasizing &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s an effective solution that has largely been overlooked: designing hospital spaces that can reduce human aggression &ndash; to calm emotionally troubled patients through architecture.&rdquo; Some psychologists are now working with architects to design less stress hospitals.</p>
<p>Noise, chaos and clutter cause stress. Space, order and emptiness promote calm. It makes perfect sense that a meditation app would utilize white space in their emails. It makes it easy for the recipient to focus and eliminates the overwhelming feeling that some emails create.</p>

<h2>ClickInsights: A Product Demonstration</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.clickinsights.io/">ClickInsights</a>, a one-click email survey tool, has the opportunity to demonstrate how their tool works within their retention emails. Clicking a link tracks an event that can be used to trigger another email and record data about the user. It&rsquo; the type of email marketing that can create an &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment for the recipient.</p>
<p>The message is short and sweet. It&rsquo;s purpose is primarily to give users an idea of how they could use the tool for their own marketing. The simplicity and plain text design makes this message easy to read and respond to.</p>

<h2>Disqus: In Between Two Actions</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know the exact formula for triggered emails, but in this case I know exactly why I received this email. I started the process of adding <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> to a new site but never finished.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="216px"><img data-attachment-id="6626" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/why-email-is-the-ultimate-defense-against-digital-sharecropping/digital-sharecropping-test/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/digital-sharecropping-test.png?fit=640%2C460&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,460" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="digital-sharecropping-test" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/digital-sharecropping-test.png?fit=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/digital-sharecropping-test.png?fit=640%2C460&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6626" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/disqus-new-site.jpg?resize=216%2C296" alt="disqus retention email" width="216" height="296"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Disqus is likely tracking two events:</p>
<ol><li>User clicks &ldquo;Add Disqus to Site&rdquo;</li>
<li>User registers new site</li>
</ol><p>They can see who triggered the first event but has yet to trigger the second, meaning they send emails like this one encouraging those users to continue.</p>
<p>The email uses the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/1-2-3-method/">1-2-3 method</a> to guide users through the process, which can seem overwhelming at first. By breaking the setup into chunks, it&rsquo;s easier for users to visualize the process and take action. I also love the orange &ldquo;Still need help?&rdquo; button that serves as a safety net for users who still aren&rsquo;t sure where to begin.</p>

<h2>Dollar Shave Club: FREE</h2>
<p>If you create a Dollar Shave Club account but don&rsquo;t enter your credit card information, you&rsquo;ll soon be the recipient of several excellent retention emails.</p>
<p>In this email, Dollar Shave Club goes all-in with one of the most powerful sales words in the English language: <strong>free</strong>. The subject line and entire body of the email stress the fact that you can try a razor for free. This is just the nudge new customers need to get over the hump.</p>
<p>The email does two other things really well. First, it uses a bold button with clear, friction free copy &ndash; &ldquo;Get Your Free Month&rdquo; &ndash; to entice recipients to click. Then, it shows a picture of the box you&rsquo;ll be receiving. Nothing eliminates the anxiety of something new like a preview.</p>

<h2>Elevate: Copywriting 101</h2>
<p>Retention emails are the perfect medium for addressing resistance. If, for example, you know that some people believe your app is too complicated, use email to tackle that issue head on.</p>
<p>This is a common copywriting technique called <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/problem-agitate-solve/">the Problem-Agitate-Solve formula</a>. On Copyblogger, Demian Farnworth explains the basics.</p>
<blockquote class="snippet"><p>The formula works like this:</p>
<ul><li>Identify a problem</li>
<li>Agitate that problem</li>
<li>Trot out the solution</li>
</ul><p>Its applications are endless.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the tactic Elevate employs in this email. They identified three reasons that users abandon their app, then address them. Authenticity and empathy are key to pulling this off, which Elevate does elegantly.</p>
<p><em>We previously used this email to demonstrate the 1-2-3 method. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/1-2-3-method/">Read more on that here.</a></em></p>

<h2>Goodreads: A Formal Invitation</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, I organized my Goodreads account by making a list of books I&rsquo;ve read and another of books I&rsquo;d like to read. Goodreads took note of this, and when they ran a giveaway for one of the books my &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list, they triggered this email.</p>
<p>As an Amazon company, I&rsquo;m not surprised that Goodreads builds these kind of triggers into their product. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Read more on Amazon&rsquo;s emails here.</a>) While this may not initially strike you as a retention email, keep in mind that it&rsquo;s triggered, personalized based on my behavior and it creates engagement that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
<p>As Jeff Bezos <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngreathouse/2013/04/30/5-time-tested-success-tips-from-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos/">said</a>, &ldquo;We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts.

<h2>Grammarly: You&rsquo;re Missing the Best Part</h2>
<p>This is a more traditional retention email. I created a <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/grammar-check" target="_blank">Grammarly</a> account but wasn&rsquo;t taking advantage of a popular feature, their Chrome browser extension. They sent this email to explain what it is, how it works and why I should install it. And it worked! I installed the extension and now use it every day.</p>
<p>By tracking events throughout your application, it&rsquo;s easy to see missed opportunities. And it&rsquo;s even easier to trigger messages to people who are missing out on valuable tools. I barely used Grammarly before installing the browser extension, and now it&rsquo;s a vital part of my writing process.</p>
<p>Grammarly alternates information with calls to action several times in this email. The bold buttons and succinct descriptions make for a compelling message. It&rsquo;s hard <em>not</em> to click.</p>

<h2>Graze: A Proven Model</h2>
<p>Graze explains exactly why I&rsquo;m receiving this email. As a copywriter, I wouldn&rsquo;t always advise this approach but it&rsquo;s highly useful for the purpose of this post.</p>
<blockquote class="snippet"><p>We noticed that you previously visited us at graze.com but haven&rsquo;t yet tried one of our handpicked snack boxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, the copy works since it guides me to most important part of the message, the free food.</p>
<p>This is almost identical to the Dollar Shave Club email in that it includes the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; multiple times, employs a bold button to entice users to click, and shows a photo of what customers can expect in the mail.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s no coincidence. If you&rsquo;re in the business of subscription boxes or e-commerce, take note of this strategy.</p>

<h2>NPR: Compound Interest</h2>
<p>Is this an onboarding, lifecycle or retention email?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter to the recipient but it matters to us, the marketers. While I don&rsquo;t know <em>exactly</em> why this email was triggered, I do know that I downloaded the NPR One app on my phone and never used it. That means I triggered one event &ndash; the download &ndash; but never triggered the next &ndash; listening to my first track. I&rsquo;m a user in limbo.</p>
<p>This gap is where retention emails shine, and it&rsquo;s the reason I love this message from NPR. Suggested content is the perfect way for NPR to poke around and see what really interests me. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">TripAdvisor</a> do this all the time.) Once they know, they can send more personalized emails. This creates a compounding effect where every new email is more personalized than the last.</p>

<h2>Pinterest: What&rsquo;s Behind Door #3?</h2>
<p>Pinterest also uses the suggested content model. They send me this email every week, each with different topics. I&rsquo;m not an engaged user, so they are mostly guessing based on the few boards I already created. The idea is to pique my interest, then get way more targeted.</p>
<p>They employ a few <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">email best practices</a> like social proof and buttons, but they also take the opportunity to explain what you can expect to see if you click. The psychology is very similar to Dollar Shave Club including a photo of the box.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/authority-intensive-2014/">2014 Authority Intensive</a> conference, Joanna Wiebe likened buttons to doors. They are much easier to click (or open) if you know what&rsquo;s behind them. Providing a preview or explanation adds important context that drives clicks. Pinterest does this with the blue callout &ndash; it explains exactly what these links are.</p>

<h2>Rogue: The World&rsquo;s Most Expected Email</h2>
<p>Recently, I was browsing the Rogue Fitness website and found a hat I really liked. When I tried to add the hat to my cart, I was presented with this message:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="462px"><img data-attachment-id="6634" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/content-marketing-examples/the-furrow/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/the-furrow.png?fit=1440%2C900&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1440,900" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="the-furrow" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/the-furrow.png?fit=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/the-furrow.png?fit=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6634" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rogue-signup.jpg?resize=462%2C156" alt="rogue signup" width="462" height="156"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Darn!</p>
<p>Still, I wanted the hat so I signed up to get a notification when it was back in stock. The stage was set for the world&rsquo;s most expected, relevant and contextual email. Sure enough, a few weeks later I received the email below and made the purchase.</p>
<p>This is some of the best email marketing out there. Rogue knows for a fact that I want this product. The email is not just expected, it&rsquo;s anticipated. I checked my email each day hoping it would arrive. And when it did, I took immediate action.</p>
<p>When customers can&rsquo;t wait for your emails to arrive, you know you&rsquo;re doing it right.</p>

<h2>RunKeeper: Benefits, Not Features</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good reason why fitness apps have become so popular. They do two things really well:</p>
<ol><li>Help users set goals, track progress and become healthier</li>
<li>Make users feel guilty when we don&rsquo;t exercise</li>
</ol><p>There is a lot of emotion tied to self-confidence and body image. When RunKeeper emails their users to reactivate them, they are asking for so much more than logging data in their app.</p>
<p>RunKeeper faces an interesting challenge. If their users don&rsquo;t go out running on a regular basis, they have no reason to use the app. In order to keep user engagement high, RunKeeper actually has to focus on motivating people to exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enviable position in some ways. People <em>know</em> they should be exercising and they know that using RunKeeper can help them lose weight and run faster. Both parties agree that app usage is a good thing. Instead of begging users to login and use their app, RunKeeper simply reminds users that getting back into an exercise routine is a good idea. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of selling benefits instead of features.</p>

<h2>SumoMe: A New Way to &ldquo;Sell&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is a report, not a retention email,&rdquo; you mutter as you scroll to the next example. Think again.</p>
<p>Personalized reports are one of the easiest ways into the inbox. These emails look and feel transactional, meaning that users open and read them without the fear or being sold to. I&rsquo;m not suggesting you should use a Trojan Horse to trick people into opening emails, but you can use reports to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; in a different way.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to retain customers is to constantly remind them how much valuable you are. Sending a report like this highlights that value in black and white. I got seven new subscribers on my site last week without lifting a finger, so I definitely plan to keep using <a href="http://sumome.com/">SumoMe</a>. Now that is retention.</p>

<h2>TaskRabbit: Email Smarter</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another email that doesn&rsquo;t immediately scream &lsquo;retention&rsquo;. A closer look, however, reveals that&rsquo;s just the goal.</p>
<p>I signed up for TaskRabbit last year, checked it out but never actually used the service. Until I do, I&rsquo;m in limbo &ndash; a segment of users who has expressed interest in TaskRabbit but never really acted on it.</p>
<p>Marketers should celebrate users in limbo. A signup is strong indicator that a person has real interest in your product. Never assume these people aren&rsquo;t the right fit as customers until it&rsquo;s been proven. The Internet is a busy place and it&rsquo;s easy to get distracted. Use retention emails like this one to bring them back.</p>

<h2>TripAdvisor: Momentum</h2>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t think I could make it through an entire post without using a TripAdvisor email, did you? (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">I love TripAdvisor&rsquo;s emails.</a>)</p>
<p>This is similar to the SumoMe report we looked at earlier but the psychology is different. SumoMe used the report to remind customers why the tool is so great. TripAdvisor uses the report to encourage users to pat themselves on the back for contributing to the travel community.</p>

<html><body><p>Segmentation in email marketing leads to higher open and click rates, fewer unsubscribes and, in general, a better experience for your customers. But most marketers don&rsquo;t invest enough time in segmentation, and a result, don&rsquo;t reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, segmentation is most useful when marketing collaborates with customer support, sales and accounting. I know &ndash; it&rsquo;s already starting to feel overwhelming which is where most people quit. Rest assured that segmentation is easier than you think and, for most, <strong>the biggest challenge to email segmentation is the right toolkit.</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a perfect example:</p>
<p>A few years ago, I worked on a segmentation campaign for a small e-commerce store. We exported data from our email provider and our shopping cart provider, then used Excel to combine the lists, match the emails, tag the customers in a number of different categories and then upload new CSVs back into the email provider to create lists. And we had to do this every week to make sure the lists were up-to-date for new email campaigns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder than most marketers don&rsquo;t spend much time on segmentation. What a pain!</p>
<p>Luckily, SaaS tools have come a long way since then and it&rsquo;s much easier to segment customers. At Vero, we&rsquo;ve done away with the concept of lists altogether and use segments as the primary way to group customers. All the data collection, tagging and segmentation happens automatically in the app.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the ways that segments are better than lists:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Segments are real-time.</strong> For example, a segment of people who viewed the pricing page twice in the last 30 days will change as different customers pass through that 30-day window. It&rsquo;s also possible to create &lsquo;static&rsquo; segments by tagging people. (Example: Manually apply a tag to your 100 best customers.)</li>
<li><strong>Segments are limitless.</strong> You can use as many conditions as you want to create segments. This includes events, opens/clicks on email campaigns, tags and user attributes (like name, location, gender, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Segments are cross-platform.</strong>  Events can be tracked across multiple mediums &ndash; apps, e-commerce store, website, blog, etc. &ndash; so segments can be created using data from all sources. For example, you can create a segment of people that opened an email campaign and created an account but never finished their profile.</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since we&rsquo;ve used Excel to segment a list and we aren&rsquo;t looking back. The best part is that is it&rsquo;s easier than ever to send emails to the right people. This makes for a dramatically better customer experience, and much less hassle for the marketing team.</p>
<p>Here are just a few ways we use segmentation in our email marketing.</p>
<h3 class="with-line">Create Targeted Onboarding Campaigns</h3>
<p>We track a lot of data about our free trial users and we use segments to keep see where new customers are in the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a>. For example, we track an event when new users save their first campaign and another when they send it. We have a segment that keeps track of people in between these two events so we can reach out with help.</p>
<p>Take a look at the rules here &ndash; it&rsquo;s grouping people who have saved a campaign but not yet sent it. We know that users who actually send campaigns are much more likely to become paying customers so we automate an email to these people and see what help they need to continue.</p>
<p>This is a good example of a dynamic campaign since the number of people in it changes based on users&rsquo; behavior.</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Measure the Success of a Campaign</h3>
<p>We use content upgrades on the blog to grow our email list. Posts with a content upgrade contain a form that triggers a unique event, such as <em><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">Requests TripAdvisor Swipe File</a></em>. (This is very easy to do with Vero&rsquo;s form builder.)</p>
<p>We then create a segment to keep track of all the people who have triggered the event &hellip;</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Monitor Inactivity</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to reduce churn is identifying customers who aren&rsquo;t getting value for their money. A good place to start is by looking at paying customers who haven&rsquo;t logged in. Once you can create this segment, you can dig into <em>why</em> they aren&rsquo;t getting value and solve the issue before they leave.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6503" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-segmentation/monitor-inactivity/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?fit=800%2C236&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,236" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Monitor Inactivity" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?fit=300%2C89&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?fit=800%2C236&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?resize=800%2C236" alt="Monitor Inactivity" width="800" height="236" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6503 example-email" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?resize=300%2C89&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?resize=50%2C15&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Monitor-Inactivity.jpg?resize=75%2C22&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h3 class="with-line">Identify Leads for Outbound Sales</h3>
<p>Segments are a great way to identify prospects who are showing interest in your product or service. <strong>We use data to measure intent.</strong> For example, each time we send an email newsletter, we create a segment that tracks prospects who opened the newsletter <em>and</em> have looked at our homepage in the last 30 days.</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Keep Track of Your Best Customers</h3>
<p>Automation is great but sometimes you need the ability to segment manually. We&rsquo;ve manually tagged our best customers with the tag &ldquo;VIP&rdquo;. This makes it easy to offers perks like beta access to new features.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. Dynamic segments give you an almost unlimited ability to dissect your database and learn about your customers. Here are a few more tips for getting the most out of Vero&rsquo;s segmentation tools.</p>
<h2>Using Vero&rsquo;s Segment Feature</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, one of biggest barriers to segmentation is the tools. Vero solves that problem. Here are a few tips to help you get the most value from our Segment feature.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Nesting:</strong> You can create segments of segments. This is useful for combining two related segments or refining an existing segment without overwriting the original.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax:</strong> We recommend using some type of syntax to organization your segments.  We use [Customers] for existing customers, [Activation] for free trial users and [Blog] for content marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Cloning:</strong> If you want to create several campaigns with minor differences, just create one, then clone it.
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://ucarecdn.com/e2b7f8a9-df35-4f4d-975a-8d67ba81c960/" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-11 15.49.44.png"></p>
<p>For example, you might create segments for customers with varying levels of activity. Set it up once then just change the one condition that makes the segment unique.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Sending campaigns:</strong> When it comes time queue up a newsletter or behavioral campaign, you can target one or more segments. Building segments into the campaigns is a constant reminder that you should be sending targeted emails.</li>
</ul><p>We encourage you to signup for a free trial and create a few segments of your own. Have any questions about segmentation? You can email us at <a href="support@getvero.com">support@getvero.com</a> or leave a note in the comments.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>One thing we often hear is, &ldquo;How can I learn more about my customers?&rdquo; Today, we have a really good answer to that question.</p>
<p>Given all the data we have at our fingertips these days, it feels wrong that we don&rsquo;t <em>truly</em> know our customers. But email is one of the best ways to change that. You can infer quite a bit from metrics like opens, clicks and page views, and leverage it as a platform for two-way communication. (Our parents called this &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo;.)</p>
<div class="subscribe-footer custom-cta">
<p>When we built Vero&rsquo;s Customer Profiles feature, we made sure that you&rsquo;d be able to collect data from all over the web. That means tracking events like page views, in-app activity and purchases, but also email engagement and manual tags.</p>
<p>With all these data points in one place, you can paint a complete picture of individual customers. And over time, these profiles get smarter as they collect more data.</p>
<p><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features/" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary">Learn more</a></p>
</div>
<p>Here are a few strategies &ndash; ranging from the old-fashioned to sophisticated &ndash; that will help you get to know your customers using email.</p>
<h2>Just Ask</h2>
<p>You knew we were going to mention surveys, but we&rsquo;ve got a new twist on this old approach.</p>
<p>We love surveys because they provide direct answers to your questions. Instead of sifting through data looking for answers, you can use simple surveys to gather lots of insight at one time, in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/" target="_blank">Dollar Shave Club</a> is great at incorporating surveys. Every now and then, I receive an email from them with a simple question like this one:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6402" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/dollar-shave-club-email-survey/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?fit=720%2C997&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="720,997" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="dollar shave club email survey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?fit=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?fit=720%2C997&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?resize=720%2C997" alt="dollar shave club email survey" width="720" height="997" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6402 example-email" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?resize=217%2C300&amp;ssl=1 217w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?resize=72%2C100&amp;ssl=1 72w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?resize=36%2C50&amp;ssl=1 36w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dollar-shave-club-email-survey.jpg?resize=54%2C75&amp;ssl=1 54w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Dollar Shave Club stands to learn a ton about their customers from this email. They&rsquo;ll find out, for example, who&rsquo;s <em>really</em> interested in their company based on who opened the email. As they gather more responses, they&rsquo;ll learn more about product-market fit and get some insight on what products could be useful in the future. This data will also help them segment users into groups when it comes time to let people know about future products. If, for example, someone responds with &ldquo;None of the above,&rdquo; then they know not to dilute that person&rsquo;s inbox with more information on the topic.</p>
<p>One-click surveys like such as this one are very easy to create with tools like <a href="http://www.clickinsights.io/" target="_blank">ClickInsights</a>. Here&rsquo;s how we would mimic Dollar Shave Club&rsquo;s survey using ClickInsights:</p>
<p>Simply create a new survey and add your questions. If you need ideas for questions, refer to ClickInsights&rsquo; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAYA9HVQuW-VFy_Thc4JrJouTQQL7C5Uw8KKNw27aDk/edit" target="_blank">suggested topics</a>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6400" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/clickinsights-survey/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?fit=630%2C596&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="630,596" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="clickinsights survey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?fit=300%2C284&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?fit=630%2C596&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?resize=630%2C596" alt="clickinsights survey" width="630" height="596" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?w=630&amp;ssl=1 630w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?resize=300%2C284&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?resize=106%2C100&amp;ssl=1 106w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?resize=50%2C47&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/clickinsights-survey.png?resize=75%2C71&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Next, you have some options around recording the data. Because Vero is already integrated with ClickInsights, you can map survey answers directly to our Contact Profiles.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6426" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/record-survey-responses-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?fit=635%2C484&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="635,484" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="record-survey-responses" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?fit=635%2C484&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="record-survey-responses" width="635" height="484" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6426" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?w=635&amp;ssl=1 635w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?resize=131%2C100&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/record-survey-responses.jpg?resize=75%2C57&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve created your survey, ClickInsights provides an HTML embed code which you can use in a rich text or HTML email in Vero. These work nicely in HTML emails because they maintain the same CSS styles as the rest of the content.</p>
<p>Data from those clicks are tracked in Vero as user attributes which you can use to create segments and automate follow-up emails.</p>
<p>For example, Dollar Shave Club automatically sends a free sample to each customer depending on which link they clicked. Dollar Shave Club then automates an email to go out after the product has been delivered to customer, asking if they would like to buy the product. </p>

<p>This is exactly how behavioral email should work: super-targeted, timely messages with no guesswork.</p>
<h2>Infer from Intent</h2>
<p>When we send a newsletter, we measure intent by creating several segments:</p>
<ul><li>Subscribers who did not open the newsletter</li>
<li>Customers who did open it</li>
<li>Non-customers who opened it</li>
<li>Non-customers who opened it AND viewed the pricing page within the last 30 days</li>
</ul><p>We do this to collect better measurements but also so that we can send follow-up emails. Newsletters don&rsquo;t quite fall under &ldquo;batch and blast&rdquo; emailing, but they generally lead to similar abysmally low conversion rates. Segmenting people based on their engagement with a newsletter and measuring that against other data is a great way for us to get to know who is <em>really</em> on our list.</p>
<p>Need more color? Here&rsquo;s an example of a recent campaign we executed:</p>
<p>First, we publish a new post and sent an announcement to our entire list, letting them know that the post was up.</p>

<p>Next, we created at least three segments based on engagement with that email. Here&rsquo;s the segment of all subscribers that did not open the email:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6408" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/vero-segment-1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?fit=677%2C327&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="677,327" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero segment 1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?fit=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?fit=677%2C327&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?resize=677%2C327" alt="vero segment 1" width="677" height="327" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6408" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?w=677&amp;ssl=1 677w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?resize=207%2C100&amp;ssl=1 207w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?resize=50%2C24&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-1.png?resize=75%2C36&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>&hellip; and here&rsquo;s one of all non-customers who did open it:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6409" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/vero-segment-2/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?fit=667%2C412&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="667,412" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero segment 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?fit=667%2C412&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?resize=667%2C412" alt="vero segment 2" width="667" height="412" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6409" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?w=667&amp;ssl=1 667w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?resize=162%2C100&amp;ssl=1 162w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-segment-2.png?resize=75%2C46&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>You get the idea &ndash; our segment builder really lets you dig in. But we&rsquo;ve found the ones mentioned here to be the most effective for our newsletter campaigns.</p>
<p>Especially interesting to us are the non-customers who opened the email since they have opted-in to receive it and opened an email that is related to Vero&rsquo;s service. Their email looks something like this:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6410" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/contactmonkey-follow-up-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?fit=716%2C533&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="716,533" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="contactmonkey follow up email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?fit=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?fit=716%2C533&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=716%2C533" alt="contactmonkey follow up email" width="716" height="533" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6410 example-email" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?w=716&amp;ssl=1 716w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=300%2C223&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=134%2C100&amp;ssl=1 134w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=50%2C37&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>While we don&rsquo;t do this for every new blog post, we do make a point of employing the tactic if the content is related to our product or has actionable advice for customers. And as a bonus, the campaign results give us valuable feedback on the quality and relevance of the content.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example &ndash; this one is a follow-up email we sent to customers who opened a recent newsletter that yielded quite a few responses and constructive feedback:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6411" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?fit=722%2C319&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="722,319" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="vero airbnb follow up email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?fit=300%2C133&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?fit=722%2C319&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=722%2C319" alt="vero airbnb follow up email" width="722" height="319" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6411 example-email" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?w=722&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=300%2C133&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=226%2C100&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=50%2C22&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vero-airbnb-follow-up-email.jpg?resize=75%2C33&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So, at it&rsquo;s core, the idea isn&rsquo;t that complicated: use the data you already have to get more valuable data. Often, your existing data aren&rsquo;t informative enough to make good decisions, but more rounded data are good enough to at least begin segmentation.</p>
<h2>Make Conversation</h2>
<p>Not all marketing strategies scale, and that&rsquo;s okay. We have a story about that.</p>
<p>We used to send new blog subscribers a series of emails about Vero. After a few months, we realized that we were trying to sell to people without knowing much about them. The campaign wasn&rsquo;t performing well since we did&rsquo;t have enough qualitative data to make it truly useful. Automation only works if the messaging is right, so we scrapped our 12-email campaign and replaced it with a single email designed to help us learn about our readers.

<p>Many people replied to that one email, and as a result we learned a ton about our readers. We struck up a conversation with many of them, directed them to helpful articles and asked more questions about their business. These types of conversation inevitably lead to relationships which are, after all, the foundation on which successful businesses are built.</p>
<p>Our process isn&rsquo;t scalable &ndash; but it sure is helpful. Once we have a better understanding of our readers&rsquo; challenges and priorities, we may test a new campaign. For now, we&rsquo;re content to chat with as many people as possible to learn as much as we can.</p>
<p>There are several other businesses I know of that see replies as a chance to learn about their customers. Here&rsquo;s an mail I received from <a href="https://beegit.com" target="_blank">Beegit</a> co-founder JD Eaton after letting my free trial lapse:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6413" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/customer-feedback/beegit-personal-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?fit=772%2C303&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="772,303" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="beegit personal email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?fit=300%2C118&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?fit=772%2C303&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?resize=772%2C303" alt="beegit personal email" width="772" height="303" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6413 example-email" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?w=772&amp;ssl=1 772w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?resize=300%2C118&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?resize=255%2C100&amp;ssl=1 255w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?resize=50%2C20&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beegit-personal-email.jpg?resize=75%2C29&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The truth was that I didn&rsquo;t have a chance to really test the software. This email sparked a conversation that led to a product demo and then a sign up. That&rsquo;s right &ndash; asking our team for feedback resulted in Vero becoming a paying customer. (Beegit is the markdown collaboration tool that we use here.)</p>
<p>Another company that does this is Feedly, which sends almost the exact same email to every customer who cancels their &ldquo;pro level&rdquo; subscription. This is a situation where the vendor has nothing to lose and plenty to gain. Resist the urge to automate these emails too much or you&rsquo;ll lose the personal touch that inspires people to reply. It has to look, feel and act like correspondence &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s triggered.</p>

<p>This too led to a conversation. While I didn&rsquo;t renew my membership, their team was able to gather feedback to improve the product.</p>
<div class="subscribe-footer custom-cta">
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In Vero, you can actually use responses to start and stop campaigns. Let&rsquo;s say, for example, you send a campaign that prompts users to schedule a product demo. When someone responds to an email, you can stop the campaign and route the request to the appropriate team member. This ensures no one receives irrelevant emails and makes it easy to build replies into your marketing.</p>

<html><body><p>Customer experience is more holistic than most businesses account for. The product loop &ndash; a phrase that helps put customer experience in perspective for online businesses &ndash; extends far beyond the core application or service. It is also comprised of customer support, email marketing, notifications, advertising and more. Anything that could trigger action, emotion or apathy regarding your business falls within the product loop.</p>
<p>Email is a part of the product loop where many businesses struggle. Whether you plan for it or not, email is central to the customer experience. Customers typically receive a welcome message, onboarding emails and a newsletter. As they use your product or app, they&rsquo;ll receive notifications too. Add in receipts, invoices, services outage notifications and pretty soon, it&rsquo;s difficult ensure you&rsquo;re presenting a consistent and enjoyable experience. A cluttered email strategy makes for a disjointed product loop.</p>

<p><strong>What we&rsquo;ve found through observation and measurement is that the smartest businesses keep it simple.</strong> They, for example, don&rsquo;t send too many newsletters and only send notifications when customers are inactive. They add value, even at the expense of losing engagement within their app or store.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the emails they send are incredibly consistent with the brand&rsquo;s style, tone and agenda. Take the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/the-retention-email/">Airbnb emails</a> we&rsquo;ve talked about so much on this blog. The Airbnb team is hell-bent on creating a great experience. If the channel, platform or medium is even tangentially related to Airbnb, the experience will be enjoyable.</p>
<p>We pulled example emails from a few businesses that really understand how important email is to the customer experience. Each takes a unique approach but all put the customer first.</p>
<h2>Slack &ndash; Focus on Inactivity</h2>
<p>A company like Slack isn&rsquo;t using email to educate, create brand awareness or drive clicks. Email falls squarely within their product loop. In fact, aside from a few onboarding emails, notifications are the only emails most customers ever get from Slack.</p>
<p><img class="example-email" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-example.jpg?resize=709%2C643" alt="slack email example" width="709" height="643"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Slack notification emails are designed to get users back in the app. The look and feel, as well as the scarcity, is indicative of this strategy.</p>
<p>For Slack, it&rsquo;s all about driving engagement. CEO Stewart Butterfield told <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5991005/slack-is-killing-email-yes-really" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, &ldquo;The [metric] we track most closely is our daily active users, because if people aren&rsquo;t using it every day it&rsquo;s not really being used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Triggering these notifications is part of larger strategy designed to get users engaged. Slack wisely tracks engagement in their apps to know when to send these emails. For example, logged-in users might receive an email notification if they don&rsquo;t respond to a mention.</p>
<p>Even more impressive, Slack includes a brief activity log from your inactive time and allows you to control notifications.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6314" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/product-loop/slack-email-footer/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?fit=669%2C301&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="669,301" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="slack email footer" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?fit=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?fit=669%2C301&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6314" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?resize=669%2C301" alt="slack email footer" width="669" height="301" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?w=669&amp;ssl=1 669w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?resize=222%2C100&amp;ssl=1 222w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?resize=50%2C22&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/slack-email-footer.png?resize=75%2C34&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Giving users control over the emails they receive is an indicator that Slack is all about value. They do their best to send only as many emails as you need but if you can get more value from greater or fewer emails, it&rsquo;s encouraged. This could very well mean fewer emails from Slack and maybe even less time in the app. That&rsquo;s okay as long as Slack is measuring customer satisfaction rather than opens and clicks.</p>
<h2>Product Hunt &ndash; A Homogeneous Experience</h2>
<p>Product Hunt is a perfect example of a community that delivers value on multiple mediums. While the main site is the activity hub, their mobile app and newsletter are complementary resources for users who prefer information on-the-go. This makes Product Hunt a community, not a destination.</p>
<p>Ryan Hoover, Product Hunt founder and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788"><em>Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</em></a> co-author, understands the importance of email as a habit-building tool. &ldquo;We check our email several times a day. If done right, email products can become a part of users&rsquo; daily habits,&rdquo; he writes on his <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/43986871442/email-first-startups" target="_blank">personal blog</a>. In fact, Ryan started Product Hunt as a standalone newsletter before building it into a membership site.</p>
<p>Lead <em>Hooked</em> author Nir Eyal <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nireyal/hooked-model" target="_blank">defines a habit</a> as &ldquo;a behavior done with little or no conscious thought.&rdquo; Checking email is a habit already ingrained in Product Hunt&rsquo;s target audience, making it the perfect external trigger for a daily routine.</p>
<p>To make this work, the platform&rsquo;s look and feel of has to be consistent everywhere. Product Hunt is familiar to users in every medium.</p>

<p>Consistency, along with frequency, make Product Hunt&rsquo;s offering an easy habit to pick up. And in the absence of any event tracking, it&rsquo;s an easy strategy for any marketer to replicate.</p>
<h2>Trello &ndash; Mirror Product Functionality</h2>
<p>Trello&rsquo;s collaboration tools rely on email to keep users updated. But they&rsquo;ve taken &rsquo;email in the product loop&rsquo; a step further by adding functionality, thereby weaving email directly into the fabric of the product.</p>
<p><img class="example-email" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trello-email.jpg?resize=741%2C644" alt="trello email" width="741" height="644"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Users can reply directly to comments on each board, meaning they spend less time in Trello but get more value from it. Stella Garber, Trello&rsquo;s VP Marketing, says this is a no-brainer. &ldquo;Replying to comments by email is simply easier from a user experience perspective than making people sign into the app. We want Trello to be accessible anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> is a smart way to put email to work.</p>
<p>Trello, like Slack, gives customers the option to receive more or less emails in the footer of every email. But unlike Slack, they don&rsquo;t push customers towards the app since the value is in ongoing collaboration, not real-time communication. They also integrate their blog content into notifications. New posts are included in all notification emails, neatly tying education back to the product.</p>

<p>Notification emails like this aren&rsquo;t just transactional messages, they are part of the product. Trello treats email like a product feature, carefully tweaking the UI, functionality and copy until everything works together seamlessly.</p>
<h2>Amazon &ndash; Timing Is Everything</h2>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we&rsquo;ve stuck with for 18 years, and they&rsquo;re the reason we&rsquo;re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on how to build a great business. We&rsquo;ve spent a lot time <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">dissecting Amazon emails on this blog</a> for good reason. The experience is knitted together by a singular goal: making customers happy.</p>
<p>One of the many manifestations of that goal is customer reviews. A study from <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-and-lifetime-customer-value">Dimensional Research</a> found that reviews impacted purchasing decisions for 90 percent of consumers. It worked for Amazon in the early days and it still works today.</p>
<p>Email is the primary driver of these reviews. I received the email below two months after purchasing a book. I checked a few other books I&rsquo;ve purchased on Amazon and found that I get the review email about 60 days after the purchase. That tells me that Amazon knows this is the sweet spot for book reviews. It&rsquo;s enough time to read the book but not too long that I&rsquo;ve forgotten about it.</p>
<p><img class="example-email" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Amazone-email.jpg?resize=724%2C593" alt="Amazon email" width="724" height="593"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The timing differs by product. For example, I also purchased a chew toy for my dog. That follow-up email arrived 30 days later. When I bought socks, the review email came 40 days later. Amazon carefully tracks this data to ensure every email arrives at the right time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of information about engagement for SaaS apps but it&rsquo;s just as important for e-commerce. For Amazon, email is a feature, not a channel.</p>
<h2>Blue Apron &ndash; Proactive Customer Support</h2>
<p>The product loop doesn&rsquo;t have to be connected by hyperlinks. For most businesses, the experience extends far beyond a laptop or smartphone. But even when the connection isn&rsquo;t seamless, email can bridge the gap.</p>
<p>For a business like Blue Apron, a service that delivers ready-to-cook food, the customer experience takes place in the kitchen.</p>
<p>They take a support-heavy approach to email. In addition to weekly shipping confirmation emails and plenty of food porn, they send proactive customer support emails. This keeps the lines of communication open and accessible.</p>
<p><img class="example-email" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/blue-apron-email.jpg?resize=732%2C857" alt="blue apron email" width="732" height="857"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Whether your business is online or offline, communication is vital to happy customers. Considering all the things that can go wrong while cooking a new recipe, emails like this are a must for Blue Apron.</p>
<p>Think about your SaaS app, store, site or community &ndash; where could customers get lost, confused, frustrated or overwhelmed? (If you can&rsquo;t think of any, you aren&rsquo;t thinking hard enough.) Triggered emails like this one help alleviate that pain proactively, making it a core strategy for happier customers.</p>
<p>Vero makes it easy to trigger emails based on behavior, inactivity, purchase history and more. Check out free trial to kick the tires free for 14 days.</p></body></html>

<p>Marketing doesn&rsquo;t end after the conversion. In fact, that&rsquo;s where it begins.</p>
<p>It costs 7x more to acquire a new customer on average than it does to keep an existing one (<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/retaining-customers/" target="_blank">source</a>). <strong>Customer retention is too important (and expensive) to overlook.</strong></p>
<p>But <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/retention-email-inspiration">customer retention</a> is more than just keeping customers. It&rsquo;s about making them happy, providing a great experience and giving them a reason to spread the word about your business.</p>
<p>As Basecamp CEO Jason Fried wrote on <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/201212/jason-fried/marketing-without-marketing.html">Inc</a>, &ldquo;If you take care of your existing customers, they will take care of your new customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To take care of your existing customers, you need a good product and great customer service. But you also need a plan for catering to prospects who don&rsquo;t reach out.</p>
<p>And while you can&rsquo;t automate everything, you can use triggered email to identify pain points and proactively address them.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/convert-with-behavioral-email/">behavioral marketing</a> comes in: collecting data about user activity and personalizing your marketing efforts based on that data.</p>
<p>Ready to put it to work? Here are four ways you can use behavioral email to better serve your users (and better retain them, too) &ndash; with examples pulled straight from my inbox.</p>
<h2>1. Targeted retention emails: Get to the point</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that customer inactivity comes in different flavors:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Initial inactivity</strong>, where a customer hasn&rsquo;t completed your onboarding process</li>
<li><strong>Partial inactivity</strong>, where a customer is only using part of your app or service</li>
<li><strong>Complete inactivity</strong>, where a customer isn&rsquo;t engaged at all<br>
Each type of inactivity has a different cause and requires a different set of triggers to nudge customers back into action.</li>
</ul><h3>Initial inactivity</h3>
<p>Onboarding is all about momentum. A user has signed up for your product &ndash; their interest is piqued. It&rsquo;s important to move them to the next step as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Once you lose that momentum, it&rsquo;s very difficult to get back because your service/product is no longer top-of-mind.</p>
<p>Using email to keep users moving can be a really effective way to retain new users before they churn. Look how Twitter encourages users to complete their profile. This email is sent 48 hours after signup if the user hasn&rsquo;t taken action:</p>

<h3>Partial inactivity</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that your business delivers value in single way. Especially if your service is complex, there may be awesome features that aren&rsquo;t getting the attention they deserve &ndash; or you may simply want to show off the customizability of your product.</p>
<p>For example, Pinterest users can pin items, follow other users and create boards. But did you know Pinterest also has location-based boards for planning travel?</p>
<p>Neither did I until they emailed me about it.</p>

<h3>Complete inactivity</h3>
<p>If a customer is completely inactive, you don&rsquo;t have much to lose when trying to bring them back. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to spread your feathers once more and remind prospects why they initially signed up.</p>
<p>In this example from Mint, they hold nothing back. A redesign, new features, new apps &hellip; there are a number of cool things that could draw a customer back in.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/inverted-pyramid-method/">Emails should typically be highly focused</a> &ndash; one call to action, one button and no distractions &ndash; but in this case, it&rsquo;s okay to spread your net far and wide since you&rsquo;re selling the entire product, not just one feature.</p>

<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>To track inactivity, you need an advanced analytics tool. <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/" target="_blank">KISSmetrics</a> and <a href="https://mixpanel.com/" target="_blank">MixPanel</a> are great options and you might consider using <a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank">Segment</a> to plug the data into your email provider.</p>
<p>Once you start collecting data, look for trends in engagement and try to replicate them.</p>
<p>For example, try to find which actions your best customers took early in their lifecycle and drive new users the same direction.</p>
<h2>2. Transactional email: Turn attention into action</h2>
<p>This is an underrated strategy for retaining customers.</p>
<p><a href="http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/4-ways-to-turn-boring-transactional-emails-into-cash/">Transactional emails</a> &ndash; receipts, invoices, notifications, reports, etc. &ndash; are opened at up to <a href="http://www.experian.com/assets/marketing-services/reports/transactional-email-report.pdf">8x the rate</a> as compared to promotional emails.</p>
<p>These emails aren&rsquo;t usually seen as a marketing platform, but it&rsquo;s free attention that few marketers take advantage of.</p>
<p>When a customer signs up or makes a purchase on your site, they expect to receive a few transactional emails: a monthly report, maybe an invoice. If those emails aren&rsquo;t carefully designed to increase engagement with your site, it&rsquo;s wasted attention.</p>
<p>Attention is hard to come by these days &ndash; don&rsquo;t waste it!</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of transactional emails that do a great job of encouraging the recipients to re-engage.</p>
<h3>The report email</h3>
<p>Reports emails &ndash; account overviews and usage updates &ndash; are welcome in the inbox because users know these emails are informative, not promotional.</p>
<p>TripAdvisor sends some of the smartest report emails I&rsquo;ve ever seen (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">see way more examples here</a>).</p>
<p>This one is a clever report that provides lots of analytics about the reviews I&rsquo;ve written. It&rsquo;s transactional &ndash; wink, wink &ndash; but there are three strong calls to action to re-engage with the site.</p>

<h3>The notification email</h3>
<p>&ldquo;You have a new follower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all gotten plenty of notifications like this. They&rsquo;re not generally perceived as marketing emails because they aren&rsquo;t selling anything &ndash; or are they?</p>
<p>In the example below, notice how Medium uses transactional language framed with social proof. It&rsquo;s highly personalized for me based on people I follow and have interacted with before &ndash; all while encouraging me to engage with the site.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6001" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/triggered-retention-emails/medium1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?fit=660%2C952&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="660,952" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Medium" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?fit=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?fit=660%2C952&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6001" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png" alt="Medium" width="660" height="952" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1 208w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?resize=69%2C100&amp;ssl=1 69w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?resize=35%2C50&amp;ssl=1 35w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Medium1.png?resize=52%2C75&amp;ssl=1 52w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<h3>The account activity email</h3>
<p>For many apps, accounts contain all kinds of interesting data and information that the user can&rsquo;t see without logging in. If you&rsquo;ve got a great product, use email as a catalyst to get them logged in and active. Let the product sell itself.</p>
<p>Google Apps sends a report like this every month whether you&rsquo;re active or not. Once you click the button, you get an overview of all the services included in your membership, not just the ones you use regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>Do a quick audit of your transactional emails so that you understand every possible way your customers hear from you.</p>
<p>If you use a third party shopping cart for example, see how you can customize your receipts or use a standalone transactional email service to send your own. Most apps allow at least some customization. Focus on utility first, then offer extras like referral codes and upsells.</p>
<h2>3. &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; emails: Because they really work</h2>
<p>Did you know that just <a href="http://sixteenventures.com/free-trial-optimization">25% of free trial users</a> actually convert to paying customers? That&rsquo;s an abysmally low number considering these are people who are interested enough in your product to check it out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; emails come in: last-ditch efforts to engage an inactive user or expiring free trial.</p>
<p>This is how Vero became a <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/" target="_blank">Help Scout</a> customer. We&rsquo;ve been a customer for two years so this was a really profitable email. There were two things about this email led to the conversion.</p>
<p>First, it reached us at just the right time. It wasn&rsquo;t that we disliked the product, it was just that we didn&rsquo;t have time to test it enough during the trial. The second killer element is the testimonial &ndash; it was just what we needed to hear.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a> does the same thing. Notice how there are no distractions &ndash; just a bit of copy and a strong call to action.</p>

<p>RunKeeper sends a very direct, frank email. They acknowledge the situation then do a great job selling the benefits of a paid membership.</p>

<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>As SaaS conversion expert <a href="http://sixteenventures.com/free-trial-optimization" target="_blank">Lincoln Murphy says</a>, the key to converting free trials is being proactive. Use email to execute on his tips for converting more users:</p>
<ul><li>If they don&rsquo;t convert and the trial ends, make them an irresistible offer.</li>
<li>If they don&rsquo;t convert, offer a downsell.</li>
<li>If they still don&rsquo;t convert, continue to educate them about your solution.</li>
</ul><h2>4. Lifecycle emails: Avoid inactivity in the first place</h2>
<p>Lifecycle emails are like bumpers in a bowling alley. They keep the ball out of the gutter and improve the chance it&rsquo;ll knock down a few pins. These emails are designed to spark very specific actions in the customer lifecycle &ndash; anything from completing a profile to adding team members.</p>
<p>Encouraging engagement adds value, making it the best way to avoid inactivity in the first place. It&rsquo;s the most proactive guard against churn and great way to educate your customers. Here are just a few ideas for lifecycle emails (though you can <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">check out 135 more examples here</a>).</p>
<h3>The milestone email</h3>
<p>Milestone emails build on momentum by creating a <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2014/11/framing.html" target="_blank">positive feedback loop</a>. Desired behavior is rewarded to encourage repetition of that behavior. Some businesses take this to an extreme with gamification (badges, awards, levels, etc.) but anyone can take advantage of milestone emails by triggering an email when a user engages.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another RunKeeper email that does a great job making the recipient feel great about using their app.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6006" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/triggered-retention-emails/runkeeper-milestone-email-1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?fit=876%2C1655&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="876,1655" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?fit=159%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?fit=542%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6006" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg" alt="RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1" width="876" height="1655" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?w=876&amp;ssl=1 876w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?resize=159%2C300&amp;ssl=1 159w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?resize=542%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 542w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?resize=53%2C100&amp;ssl=1 53w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?resize=26%2C50&amp;ssl=1 26w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RunKeeper-Milestone-Email-1.jpg?resize=40%2C75&amp;ssl=1 40w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px"></p>
<p>Airbnb are masters of behavioral email marketing (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/">more on that here</a>). They gather data as users browse their site and send targeted follow up emails.</p>
<p>For example, if I look at listings in San Diego, I can expect a follow up email like the one below. They even take into account the price range of the listings I checked out to make sure the email is as relevant as possible.</p>

<p>Browsing history shows intent. It&rsquo;s just like browsing a retail store. You might pick up an item, see how it looks, feels and smells. And if the store is smart, a salesperson will offer to help you. This email is like that salesperson.</p>
<h3>The personalized recommendation email</h3>
<p>Did you know that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">70% of brands</a> don&rsquo;t personalize their emails? That&rsquo;s a shame since personalized subject lines have been shown to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">increase open rates by as much as 22%</a>.</p>
<p>Subject lines are just the tip of the iceberg. It&rsquo;s easy to monitor behavior inside your app or site then personalize emails based on that data.</p>
<p>Spotify, for example, keeps track of the artists I listen to then sends emails like this when the artists release new music.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="620px"><img data-attachment-id="6009" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/triggered-retention-emails/spotify-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?fit=620%2C869&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="620,869" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Spotify" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?fit=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?fit=620%2C869&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6009" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify" width="620" height="869" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?w=620&amp;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?resize=71%2C100&amp;ssl=1 71w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?resize=36%2C50&amp;ssl=1 36w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spotify.jpg?resize=54%2C75&amp;ssl=1 54w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<p>I use Spotify every day but emails like this ensure that I always have something new and exciting to check out. Each time I get one of these, my reliance on (and love for) Spotify grows deeper.</p>

<p>Our blog posts are normally loaded with examples and screenshots.</p>
<p>Not today.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because hardly anyone is using the replenishment email strategy. If you sell items that need to be replenished, you are leaving recurring revenue on the table.</p>
<h2>What Is a Replenishment Email?</h2>
<p>A replenishment email is one that simply reminds people to re-order items when they run out. Replenishment emails are designed to drive recurring revenue. They are perfect example of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/convert-with-behavioral-email/">behavioral email marketing</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-5873"></span></p>
<p>Dog food is a great example. When a customer buys dog food, take note of how much they bought and when they bought it. Then, send them an email reminder when it&rsquo;s time to order again.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5880" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/replenishment-email/dog-food-replenishment-email/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?fit=659%2C479&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="659,479" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="dog food replenishment email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?fit=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?fit=659%2C479&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5880" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg" alt="dog food replenishment email" width="659" height="479" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?w=659&amp;ssl=1 659w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?resize=138%2C100&amp;ssl=1 138w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dog-food-replenishment-email.jpg?resize=75%2C55&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px"></p>
<p>This strategy rocks because you know the customer has a need. You even know when they need it. It&rsquo;s a pain point that&rsquo;s easy to relieve. If you sell products that can be re-ordered, you are crazy <em>not</em> to send this email.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Send Replenishment Emails</h2>
<p>Would you rather convert a new customer or retain an existing one?</p>
<p>The e-commerce world is realizing something that SaaS companies figured out a long time ago: Recurring revenue is great for the customer and the business. The business can spend more time on a better product since value and retention are king.</p>
<p>Subscription businesses are an extreme version of this &ndash; think Birchbox, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/dollar-shave-club/">Dollar Shave Club</a>, Blue Apron, etc. &ndash; but you don&rsquo;t have to change your business model to take advantage of recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Amir Elaguizy, CEO of Cratejoy, writing about the topic on <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/12/17/why-subscription-business-models-will-transform-every-industry/" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Subscription] enables merchants to build a better business from the ground up. Subscription businesses are based on retention versus conversion, which means a better ROI on customer acquisition. They can better forecast the demand for raw materials, essentially solving the inventory problem. As a result, revenue is more predictable. In the end, businesses are smarter and faster.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Replenishment emails are the easiest way to earn more recurring revenue. </strong><a href="http://ctt.ec/6c5Dq" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<p>The world is moving in this direction. Take Amazon&rsquo;s new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button" target="_blank">Dash Button</a> as proof. All it does is make replenishment dead simple. You have the tools to do with email. Instead of physical buttons, put a virtual one in your emails.</p>

<h2>How to Send Replenishment Emails</h2>
<p>Using the dog food example, you can figure out how long the bag will last based on the size. You could even ask your customers to take a quick survey about how many dogs they have and how old they are. <strong>This is simple data that could lead to easy sales.</strong></p>
<p>Timing is key. If, for example, you determine that customers will need a new bag of dog food every 30 days, you could use this sample workflow:</p>
<ul><li>Day 1 &ndash; Customer buys dog food</li>
<li>Day 20 &ndash; Remind customer to replenish</li>
<li>Day 27 &ndash; Remind customer to replenish (if they haven&rsquo;t already)</li>
<li>Day 30 &ndash; Cycle starts again</li>
</ul><p>Vero is built to send replenishment emails campaigns. Because Vero can trigger emails based on activity and inactivity, you can ensure you aren&rsquo;t asking customers to replenish if they&rsquo;ve already made a purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Set it up once and let it drive revenue all by itself. </strong></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/28102?token=noFXGrB_9ILWEjdfxaymj3Clgiw0gGaKlLjouzqmdec1O2fb2dJt7H-dWdza8xJrcQYKcV85fcC9SucFJrWBX9c" alt="replenishment email example.jpg"></p>
<p>When it comes to copywriting and calls to action in a replenishment email, <a href="http://sixteenventures.com/" target="_blank">SaaS growth expert Lincoln Murphy</a> recommends digging into the psychology of the purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>
It&rsquo;s important to understand why your customer buys the same product over and over. If we&rsquo;re talking about dog food, chances are, they&rsquo;re a conscientious dog parent that wants to ensure consistency in their puppy&rsquo;s diet.</p>
<p>If you understand the &ldquo;why&rdquo; that motivates your customer, then you can use that in your messaging in the replenishment emails themselves, but also in your emails between orders (that you use to stay top of mind) to ensure they&rsquo;re going to be ready to buy when the re-order email comes across.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to make re-ordering as simple as you can, by reducing the number of steps to as few as possible. Maybe let them select reorder right from the email, showing them the dog food bag size they&rsquo;ll be shipped and literally taking them from the email to the &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; page. Or, maybe you have two options; the primary CTA is the reorder button while the secondary CTA takes them to a screen to choose the bag size for this order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, make it easy to keep the dog food coming.</p>
<h2>Take It To The Next Level</h2>
<p>I sometimes buy dog food at stores like PetSmart. They have a loyalty program but they don&rsquo;t use it to sell me things they know I need. What is the point of a loyalty program if you don&rsquo;t use it to sell?</p>
<p>What PetSmart (and nearly every other brick and mortar store) fails to do is bridge the gap between offline and online shopping.</p>
<p>PetSmart knows a lot about me &ndash; phone number, email address, type of pet, etc. &ndash; but they never send targeted emails. Instead of sending me <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/petsmart-email-example.jpg" target="_blank">junk like this</a> (no personalization, not data-driven, barely even a call to action), why not remind m to replenish my dog food?</p>
<p>It makes my life easier since I need to buy more anyway. All brick and mortar stores should be doing this <em>yesterday</em>.</p>
<hr><p>If you want serious ROI from your email, this is how you do it.</p>

<p>There are about six million articles on the Internet that offer <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">email marketing tips</a>. Most aren&rsquo;t very good. Read a few of them and you&rsquo;ll come away thinking that a subject line A/B test is the only thing standing between your little startup and an IPO.</p>
<p><span id="more-5817"></span></p>
<p>We have a different take on email.</p>
<p><strong>We believe email is about trust and two-way communication. </strong><em><a href="http://ctt.ec/dG9fU" target="_blank">Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</a></em></p>
<p>These ten counterintuitive email marketing lessons sum up nearly everything we believe (and know) about email. If this article makes you feel a little uneasy about your current strategy, good. That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<h2>1. Email isn&rsquo;t about selling.</h2>
<p>Do you watch TV for the commercials?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Do you check email for marketing newsletters?</p>
<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>Email isn&rsquo;t about selling. </strong>The primary reason people use email is to communicate with friends and co-workers. Secondarily, they use it to sign up for apps and services. (All social networks, for example, require an email address to create an account.) Receiving marketing materials is a side effect of using email for other reasons.</p>
<p>Despite all you&rsquo;ve heard about email as a channel, it&rsquo;s just a platform for communication. It&rsquo;s a great place to learn about what your leads and customers <em>want</em> and <em>need</em> but not necessarily the place to close deals.</p>
<p>Think about email as one piece of a multi-channel strategy where trust grows over time. Eventually, there is a tipping point but no single channel gets all the credit.</p>
<p>Aim for less noise:</p>

<h2>2. Email isn&rsquo;t that great at driving traffic.</h2>
<p>Since January 1, 2015, email has driven 12 percent of the total traffic to the Vero blog. Of that traffic, about 20 percent came from newsletters besides our own.</p>
<p>That accounts for nearly 50,000 visits. That&rsquo;s great but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the 130,000 organic search visits we&rsquo;ve earned over that same period.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wxoJJBmli6AfKGoBw6YG26tfE6eZNsKVY4Xh9phkHI/pubchart?oid=1901223879&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>If traffic is your primary goal, SEO has more potential than email. It scales faster and works for you 24/7.</p>
<p>Email does, however, drive targeted traffic. Because subscribers have opted-in to receive your emails, they are predisposed to like you and visit your site.</p>
<p>Our email traffic stays on the site for three minutes and one second on average, 67 percent longer than organic traffic (one minute and 48 seconds).</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wxoJJBmli6AfKGoBw6YG26tfE6eZNsKVY4Xh9phkHI/pubchart?oid=1918784050&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>What can we make of this data? SEO is a better source of new leads and email is better tool for nurturing relationships.</p>
<h2>3. Promotional email isn&rsquo;t a priority.</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the term <strong>email marketing</strong>?</p>
<p>Coupons? Sale this weekend? Another newsletter?</p>
<p>Email marketing is many things. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/promotional-emails/">Promotional email</a> is just one way it can be used to communicate with customers, subscribers, users and leads.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">analysis of 100 million emails</a>, we found that transactional emails have a click rate that is 42 percent higher than newsletters. For every 100 clicks you get on a newsletter, you get 142 on a transactional email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5840" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/transactional-email-click-rates-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="transactional-email-click-rates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5840" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg" alt="transactional-email-click-rates" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>We also talked about the email sweet spot &hellip; that perfect place where emails are expected, contextual, personalized and relevant (i.e. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a>).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5841" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/email-marketing-sweet-spot-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=660%2C477&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="660,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email-marketing-sweet-spot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=660%2C477&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5841" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png" alt="email-marketing-sweet-spot" width="660" height="477" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=138%2C100&amp;ssl=1 138w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=75%2C54&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<p>Lifecycle emails should be your first priority. Promotional emails, subject line testing, button color A/B tests &hellip; that&rsquo;s all fine <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve laid a foundation of automated lifecycle emails.</p>
<p>If the graph above doesn&rsquo;t convince you, here&rsquo;s another way to think about it.</p>
<p>When you create a triggered lifecycle email, it works for you over and over again. Assuming your targeting is right, it arrives at the right time in the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/great-lifecycle-emails/">customer lifecycle</a> every time.</p>
<p>Compare that to promotional emails, which need to be created over and over again. And even if you segment your lists, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to send the right offer to every single person. It&rsquo;s essentially just guessing.</p>
<h2>4. Replies are a huge win.</h2>
<p>One conversion metric you might not be measuring is replies.</p>
<p>Here are two important things to think about:</p>
<p>First, people are likely already responding to your emails. If you aren&rsquo;t checking those responses, track them down. If you send a weekly newsletter to thousands of people, there is intel in those responses that can help you close leads and improve your content.</p>
<p>At Vero, we filter responses to our newsletter through <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/" target="_blank">Help Scout</a> so that we can assign the right team member to handle each one. Most responses are &ldquo;Out of Office&rdquo; replies but each week, we find a few people who need help getting started with Vero or have ideas for improving the newsletter.</p>

<p>Second, you can simply ask people to reply to your emails. Here&rsquo;s an example of an email we automate when new users start their first campaign:</p>

<p>Whatever you do, never send email from an address like &ldquo;noreply@business.com&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a surefire way to let your subscribers know it&rsquo;s a one-way conversation.</p>
<h2>5. You don&rsquo;t need to spend a fortune.</h2>
<p>We recently published case studies about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">TripAdvisor</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon&rsquo;s email marketing strategy</a>. As you might imagine, these companies are highly sophisticated and totally automated.</p>
<p>We got a lot of great feedback on those posts but one comment we heard over and over again was, &ldquo;Those are huge companies with massive marketing budgets. How can I send emails like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two comments on this point:</p>
<p>First, anyone can send triggered, personalized emails. Software like Vero starts at $99/month and has all the power you need to send emails like TripAdvisor and Amazon.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features/">Check out our features over here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Second, you don&rsquo;t build an email program like Amazon&rsquo;s overnight. It takes time. When people ask us where to start, our answer is always the same &ndash; at the beginning.</p>
<p>Onboarding is a great place to kick things off since you can get an ROI so quickly. In order, your first three triggered emails should be:</p>

<p>Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll have an automated email system working 24/7.</p>
<h2>6. Subject lines don&rsquo;t drive opens.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common myth that the subject line is what gets an email opened.</p>
<p>Sure, it factors in but <strong>emails get opened because of the rapport established between the sender and the recipient</strong>. <a href="http://ctt.ec/2VCkf" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<p>Take Alexis Madrigal&rsquo;s newsletter as an example. You won&rsquo;t find a lot of flash in his subject lines. That&rsquo;s because it isn&rsquo;t necessary. People subscribe to and open his newsletter because he sends it. They trust him. Readers like it, so they open the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Trust is scalable.</strong> <em><a href="http://ctt.ec/C9f5B" target="_blank">Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</a></em></p>

<p>Instead of asking, &ldquo;How can I get more people to open my emails?&rdquo; ask, &ldquo;How can I earn more trust?&rdquo; <a href="http://ctt.ec/Ke5V6" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this&ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<h2>7. Design is less important than you think.</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about sending beautiful, mobile-responsive emails. That&rsquo;s super important <em>if</em> you&rsquo;re sending HTML emails. Most of our best performing email campaigns are rich text. It&rsquo;s the perfect middle ground between plain text and HTML.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="608px"><img data-attachment-id="5849" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/rich-text-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=608%2C379&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="608,379" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rich text email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=608%2C379&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5849" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png" alt="rich text email" width="608" height="379" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?w=608&amp;ssl=1 608w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=160%2C100&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=75%2C47&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"></p>
<p>One problem with HTML emails is that there is too much emphasis on design. Rich text emails help you focus on writing for audience of one. <a href="http://ctt.ec/BO1j7" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a><em> (This is the single most important email copywriting tactic!)</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from our friend <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-templates-hurt-business/">Nathan Barry</a> on the topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best way to market online is to teach, to regularly deliver valuable content to your audience so that they will trust you and eventually want to purchase from you. So when you send an email, what part of the communication delivers the most value?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the content. <strong>So we should be stripping away everything else that isn&rsquo;t necessary in order to focus on the content.</strong> Multi-column layouts, background images, logos, and all the other nonsense that typically fills marketing emails doesn&rsquo;t deliver value to the recipient. Instead it is all about you, the sender. Flip that around and start delivering value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rich text emails can leverage some design, like buttons. A simple email with a bold button is a sweet spot for design. If you are looking for a quick way to increase click-through rates, this is a tactic you should try.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, rich text emails are mobile-friendly by default.</p>

<h2>8. Don&rsquo;t send emails on holidays or weekends.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a <em>good idea</em> to send timely emails but it&rsquo;s a <em>bad idea</em> to send emails when people don&rsquo;t want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Think about your favorite holiday, maybe it&rsquo;s Thanksgiving. It&rsquo;s a day for family and friends, not email. The truth is that your brand isn&rsquo;t important enough in your customers&rsquo; lives to email them on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>A note that says &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so thankful to have you as a customer&rdquo; takes away from their holiday. It&rsquo;s not timely, it&rsquo;s tacky.</p>
<p>The same goes for weekends. Even though <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">data will tell you open rates are steady over the weekend</a>, have some respect for down time. No one wants your email when they are trying to get away from screens for 48 hours to spend time with their family.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a timely email. Apple just announced a new MacBook and this email is being sent existing Gazelle customers. The context is built-in.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s an example of tacky email. Target is fishing for a few extra dollars at the risk of annoying their customers.</p>

<p>Understand the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I received a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/happy-birthday-email.jpg" target="_blank">&ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; email</a> from my student loan lender &hellip; the <strong>last</strong> people I want to hear from on my birthday. This fits perfectly into <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/03/what-brand-babblers-dont-understand.html" target="_blank">Bob Hoffman&rsquo;s brand babble</a> scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having a successful brand is very important to a marketer. But the idea that it is anything like that to a consumer is folly. Brand babble is just the faulty conflation of marketers&rsquo; needs and consumers&rsquo; interests.</p></blockquote>
<h2>9. The bigger the list, the worse the emails.</h2>
<p>So you have 100,000 people on your list? That&rsquo;s great, <em>unless</em> you are sending the same email to every single one.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Each of those 100,000 people has their own budget and their own buying motivations. Each is in a different place in the customer lifecycle. <strong>Sending the same message to all of them is a wasted opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>As the size of the list grows, so does the variety of people on it. Eventually, you are just targeting the &ldquo;average&rdquo; buyer and leaving out the majority of the people on the list. That&rsquo;s no way to build trust. You are the noise.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, you would send each of those 100,000 people a unique email. That&rsquo;s hard to do unless you automate the process.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid sending watered-down emails use external attributes to send super-personalized emails.</p>
<p><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/external-attributes/" target="_blank">See how Vero allows you to do this.</a></p>
<p>Check out this <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/" target="_blank">email from Airbnb</a>. We&rsquo;ve referred to it as the perfect behavioral email but it&rsquo;s actually not very hard to send.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi {First.name},</p>
<p>[insert data from browsing history]</p>
<p>[insert call to action]</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not the right fit, here are some other options.</p>
<p>[insert other listings in the same area and price range]</p></blockquote>
<p>Once the framework for an email like this is built, it can be automatically triggered over and over again. On a popular site like Airbnb, 100,000 emails might be triggered in just a few days. And each one is personalized, contextual and highly targeted.</p>
<p>Notice there is little reliance on design, copy or subject lines. It&rsquo;s <strong>all</strong> about context.</p>
<p>There is one important caveat to this. If people opt-in to a newsletter and that&rsquo;s all they receive, you can grow trust and audience simultaneously. Take Moz, for example, who send a bimonthly newsletter called the <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10" target="_blank">Moz Top 10</a>.</p>

<p>This works because the emphasis is on community and knowledge sharing. Moz is selling trust, not products.</p>
<h2>10. You can email people every day &hellip;</h2>
<p>&hellip; if they are expecting it.</p>
<p>Frequency is entirely dependent on the expectation the sender has set with the recipients. Digg, for example, offers an email every day so that&rsquo;s exactly what they deliver.</p>

<p>To be fair, many companies haven&rsquo;t set an expectation. So how often should they send emails?</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/" target="_blank">massive analysis</a>, we found that e-commerce businesses actually get more clicks on the second email of the week.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found that e-commerce businesses generally fared better when they sent multiple emails per week. One particularly high lift was the difference between one and two emails a week. On average, e-commerce customers saw an average click rate of 7.8% if they sent one email per week, while those that sent two saw an increase of 27% with an average click rate of 9.94%.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting. But don&rsquo;t let the data guide you down the wrong path. More is not always better, <em>even if the numbers initially indicate it</em>.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the recipients&rsquo; shoes. Do you really want 2-3 emails per week from one company? It&rsquo;s likely that a temporary increase in frequency will net you more conversions in the short term but it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Be careful not to falsely conclude that more is better. When it comes to frequency, it&rsquo;s better to earn and maintain trust rather than cannibalize your list.</p>
