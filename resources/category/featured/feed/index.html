<html><body><p>With the redesign of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com" target="_blank">our homepage</a> and the release of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion" target="_blank">Fusion</a> today, we&rsquo;re re-affirming our vision here at Vero to help Product Teams use customer data to create best-in-class email interactions.</p>
<p>Over the coming few months you should see some important updates from us on this blog regarding methodology, product updates and new releases. I invite you to keep up to date with our blog and follow our <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/release-notes" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>, which will be updated every few weeks.</p>
<hr><p>Vero was founded in 2012 and, initially, our focus was on helping marketers use real time customer activity to power automated email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>To begin, we developed a software solution that centred on an API to collect your customer activity via a real time event stream and a UI to create automated email campaigns.</p>
<p>The promise was that simple but powerful API libraries would provide marketing with a rich data stream <strong>without</strong> any real engineering interaction and that Vero&rsquo;s software would enable them to visually create and manage email content, user segments and automated workflows.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the intervening four years. Critically, we&rsquo;ve observed that the organizations who see the <strong>best</strong> results have Product, Engineering and Marketing Teams that <strong>collaborate</strong> to develop high-quality emails. In other words, the <strong>entire</strong> organization is invested in their customers&rsquo; experience of their products. These teams work together closely to ensure that data in and emails out are both accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>For these customers, Vero provides a platform for several or more employees from different teams to <strong>work together</strong> to deploy high quality email experiences: experiences that are heavily data-driven and personalised.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, we want to highlight that Vero is the platform that enables Product, Engineering and Marketing teams to collaborate on product experiences. What we have built today is just the beginning of what we want to build to help teams achieve their goal of providing customers with consistent, personal and valuable experiences of their product(s).</p>
<p>This direction is informed by our vision for Vero: to enable organizations to use their data to deliver products with more utility.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://veropublic.wpengine.com">new homepage</a> brings clarity to this vision and summarises the approach forward-thinking teams are taking to building high quality email experiences &ndash; the approach used by Vero&rsquo;s best customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just getting started. In order to achieve our vision we need to continue to build out tools that help customers achieve:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Data accuracy </strong>&ndash; ensuring complete and accurate data is available for personalisation and modelling, as organizations invest too much time synchronizing and managing the accuracy of their data.</li>
<li><strong>Highly available user models </strong>&ndash; in order to create personalized, valuable product experiences, you have to have data about your customers at the ready, whether they are interacting on-site, in a mobile application or via an email or message.</li>
<li><strong>Efficacious customer interactions, at scale</strong> &ndash; companies are collecting more data and reaching more users than ever before. Ensuring customers have the right experience with accurate data at scale requires a well-defined collaboration and deployment process.</li>
</ul><p>Vero already helps organizations deploy hundreds of millions of valuable email interactions every month and we look forward to working together as we build out the tooling and methodology to help you maintain data accuracy, model your customers and ensure your customer interactions are reliable every time, regardless of your scale.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried Vero before, or if haven&rsquo;t visited it in some time, I invite you to <a href="https://app.getvero.com/signup">create an account</a> and learn more about how we&rsquo;re helping teams collaborate more effectively to deploy more valuable email experiences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking ahead to a fantastic next 12 months &ndash; and can&rsquo;t wait to share updates with you along the way.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Where does product end and marketing begin?</p>
<p>For some businesses, that&rsquo;s a rhetorical question. It&rsquo;s pointless to differentiate when user experience is the sole focus.</p>
<p>The inbox is a perfect example. Email has become synonymous with noise and indifference. A few companies have opted out of the email runaround by approaching the inbox as an extension of their product.</p>
<p>Users gravitate towards utility wherever it exists. Email can deliver functionality and earn habitual engagement. It&rsquo;s as important to product development as web, desktop, and mobile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/grammar-check" target="_blank">Grammarly</a>, today&rsquo;s case study subject, understands exactly how to execute on this. Their emails check all the boxes of a great product: useful, accessible, interesting and personalized. The inbox is no longer for marketing, it&rsquo;s for experience.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6973" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-screenshot/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-screenshot.png?fit=700%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="700,240" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly screenshot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-screenshot.png?fit=300%2C103&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-screenshot.png?fit=700%2C240&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6973" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-screenshot.png" alt="grammarly screenshot" width="700" height="240" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-screenshot.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-screenshot.png?resize=300%2C103&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>Millions of people rely on Grammarly to check their emails, social media updates and documents for grammatical errors.</p>
<p>On the surface, Grammarly is a simple browser extension. What most users don&rsquo;t know is that it&rsquo;s actually a carefully crafted product, supported by a growing team engineers, linguists and data scientists. Grammar is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MrDrewPrice" target="_blank">Drew Price</a>, Grammarly&rsquo;s head of product marketing, sees the product as part of the quantified self movement. Fitbit tracks your steps, Grammarly tracks your words. In each case, the goal is the same: track the data, identify trends and find ways to improve.</p>
<p>Whether you call yourself a writer or not, you spend plenty of time writing emails, updating social media sites, sending client-facing emails or drafting proposals.</p>
<p>The written word is a fundamental skill for all knowledge workers. Grammarly aims to make progress an enjoyable experience. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s genuinely fun, for the first time, to have insights on your writing habits,&rdquo; says Price.</p>
<h2>Building a Product Lifecycle from the Ground Up</h2>
<p>The market is right for self-tracking. At least 69 percent of Americans are already tracking a health indicator according to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/01/28/tracking-for-health/">Pew Internet</a>. As that market grows, more people are turning to technology for help collecting data. All evidence indicates that health tracking is just the beginning.</p>
<p>That said, turning a tedious task like writing into a lifestyle is a real challenge. To do it, Price and the team at Grammarly are tapping into the core principles of a stickiness: gamification, community, and a first-class experience.</p>
<p>Because they track writing on multiple devices and platforms, email has become a central element to the Grammarly product. In fact, all of the data points &ndash; words written, errors made, and vocabulary used &ndash; are delivered in a concise weekly email.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weekly reports product is meant to be our bread and butter from an email perspective,&rdquo; says Price. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a retention/engagement hybrid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6954" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-weekly-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg?fit=865%2C3512&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="865,3512" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly weekly email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg?fit=74%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg?fit=252%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6954" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg" alt="grammarly weekly email" width="865" height="3512" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg?w=865&amp;ssl=1 865w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg?resize=74%2C300&amp;ssl=1 74w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-weekly-email.jpg?resize=252%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 252w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></p>
<p>This email is sent to every Grammarly user, every Monday. It&rsquo;s not meant to drive conversions &ndash; the email digest is an actual product feature.</p>
<h2>How to Tell a Story with Data</h2>
<p>Numbers can tell a story. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons self-tracking has caught on. Increasing your daily step count can trigger weight loss and improved energy. Expanding your vocabulary and making fewer mistakes leads to better writing.</p>
<p>Grammarly adds context to the data they collect. They, for example, compare your data to other users. This fosters a sense of community and serves as social proof for new users.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="548px"><img data-attachment-id="6955" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-mistakes-made/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?fit=548%2C303&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="548,303" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly mistakes made" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?fit=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?fit=548%2C303&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6955" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png" alt="grammarly mistakes made" width="548" height="303" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?w=548&amp;ssl=1 548w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>They pair hard numbers with targeted content. By dynamically inserting content based on activity, Grammarly provides a logical next step for users seeking to improve. If they notice you tend to forget commas, you&rsquo;ll see content based on that topic.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="534px"><img data-attachment-id="6956" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-targeted-content/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-targeted-content1.png?fit=534%2C341&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="534,341" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly-targeted-content" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-targeted-content1.png?fit=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-targeted-content1.png?fit=534%2C341&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6956" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-targeted-content1.png" alt="grammarly-targeted-content" width="534" height="341" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-targeted-content1.png?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-targeted-content1.png?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></p>
<h2>Segmenting the Product for a Better Experience</h2>
<p>There are three versions of the weekly progress email. The one above is sent to users who tracked more than 100 words in the last week. Another is sent to users who tracked between one and 99 words. This group has obviously tested the product and needs either encouragement or technical support.<br>
A third version is sent to users who didn&rsquo;t track any words. They address common reasons for churn and use a strong call to action to draw users back into the fold.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6957" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/2-grammarly-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=753%2C732&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="753,732" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly-inactivity" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=753%2C732&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg" alt="grammarly-inactivity" width="753" height="732" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px"></p>
<p>Within these segments are more segments. Grammarly breaks out active users with more than 100 mistakes in the last week for advanced targeting. These users stand to benefit from the premium product, so they see different copy and calls to action.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="504px"><img data-attachment-id="6958" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?fit=504%2C282&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="504,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly-upgrade-to-premium" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?fit=504%2C282&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6958" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg" alt="grammarly-upgrade-to-premium" width="504" height="282" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?w=504&amp;ssl=1 504w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"></p>
<p>In addition to the weekly report, Grammarly uses <a href="/resources/saas-onboarding-emails/" target="_blank">email to onboard new users</a>, promote the premium product and update blog readers. To avoid overlap with autoresponders and behavioral campaigns, they always send the weekly report on Monday. Engagement and retention campaigns are always prioritized above promotional email. This can mean heavy segmenting, but it&rsquo;s worth the effort to keep happy users engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing I want to do is frustrate people who use and love the product,&rdquo; says Price.</p>
<h2>Email as Product, Experience as Marketing</h2>
<p>With all the attention to detail in the reports, you might expect that Grammarly&rsquo;s other emails are equally exceptional. You&rsquo;d be right.</p>
<p>Most users discover Grammarly browser extension first, so the team has mapped most of the campaigns around that organic journey.</p>
<p>They also offer a text editor, but Price and his team have found that the extension is the stickiest product. You&rsquo;ll notice an emphasis on the extension in the emails. Retention is key. If users love the extension, they are much more likely to explore the text editor and eventually upgrade.</p>
<p>As a result of the product layers, Grammarly has created <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle campaigns</a> to match the different ways users discover and use the products. Price is quick to emphasize that &ldquo;there is no one-size-fits-all approach.&rdquo; Each campaign is created with a single goal in mind, based on the attributes of the target users.</p>
<p>Take their <a href="/resources/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a> for example. Users who initially register for the browser extension receive a different email than those who sign up only for the text editor.</p>

<p>Each email is the first in a series that takes users through the respective product. The campaigns are course-correction for users-they either address inactivity or build on momentum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go through our funnel one time and decline the prompt to install the browser extension, we don&rsquo;t send a traditional welcome email,&rdquo; says Price. &ldquo;We focus on encouraging that user to re-think installing our extension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That email (shown below) is general, but the campaign gets more specific if the user doesn&rsquo;t take action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the initial inactivity email, we try to get very specific,&rdquo; says Price. &ldquo;One email is around privacy concerns because we&rsquo;ve done surveys and know that some people worry about what we&rsquo;re doing with their data. Another focuses on extra features, like <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/words/">our thesaurus</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Technical issues can also be a challenge for new users. They must, for example, be logged-in to track their writing over time. The longer inactivity persists, the more Grammarly digs into the roadblocks. It is paramount that users overcome this initial hurdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting that first product install is the main KPI for the abandoned install stream. It&rsquo;s not about converting you to premium, it&rsquo;s about just getting you to install and use our product for the first time. That&rsquo;s the main goal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These emails are successful because Grammarly finds the right moment, not time, to send them. But they also employ some sophisticated copywriting and design that leaves the user feeling unsatisfied.</p>

It&rsquo;s a tried-and-true gamification strategy with plenty of science to support its efficacy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works in marketing and product design: Progress bars show users there is more work to do. That creates a tension that users can only relieve by completing the task.</p>

<p>Grammarly uses copy and images to reward users for their progress and remind them that their work isn&rsquo;t finished. The result is a nagging feeling of incompleteness. Upgrading is the only way to satisfy the feeling.</p>
<h2>Building Relationships and Trust with Email</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Think long-term. Think of creating an optimal relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those are Drew Price&rsquo;s words of advice for email marketers. It&rsquo;s easy to say and hard to execute.</p>
<p>In general, Grammarly&rsquo;s emails are interesting and personalized. But there is one email that really speaks to how seriously Grammarly takes Price&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6966" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/7-grammarly-newsletter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?fit=766%2C1041&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="766,1041" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="7-grammarly-newsletter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?fit=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?fit=753%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6966" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg" alt="7-grammarly-newsletter" width="766" height="1041" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?w=766&amp;ssl=1 766w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?resize=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1 221w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?resize=753%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 753w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px"></p>
<p>Instead of adding every new user to the newsletter list &ndash; a common, albeit frustrating, practice &ndash; they ask users if they&rsquo;d like to receive updates from the company blog.</p>
<p>This is subtle but important. If Grammarly added new users to the newsletter by default, they&rsquo;d water down their own product by adding noise to the inbox. The opt-in request provides a cleaner experience and fosters a trusting relationship in the process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing easy about putting together exceptional email campaigns. The initial creation process required contributions from six people, including two designers, a handful of developers and the company&rsquo;s co-founder. A team of three handles the maintenance and testing of the existing campaigns. As Price says, &ldquo;creating a great customer experience is never done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many one-size-fits-all best practices. It&rsquo;s about figuring out the relationship you want to have with your customers, then working backward. Be surgical.&rdquo;</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Why does evergreen content rule? Because we are linking to articles that aren&rsquo;t new but still delivery massive value.</p>
<p>As content creators, it&rsquo;s our goal to create evergreen resources that our readers can learn from for years to come. These articles are all evergreen whether they were published this week or last year. Take note of their content but also their strategy. They must be good if we are linking to them months after publication.</p>
<p>Did we miss anything great? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></h2>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a bunch of stuff.</p>
<h3>Lets insert a H3 tag</h3>
<p>If you want we can then do a series of bullets as well:</p>
<ul><li>Here&rsquo;s one bullet!</li>
<li>And another, this one is a little longer so we&rsquo;ll just type out a line or two really quickly. How fast can you type? I can type out 130 words per minute nearly, which is pretty insane!</li>
<li><a href="http://app.getvero.com">In this one</a> here&rsquo;s a link at the start!</li>
</ul><p>What if we also have a series of numerical steps to follow along there:</p>
<ol><li>Uno!</li>
<li>Due&hellip;&Atilde;&copy; non difficile a leggere italiano, se domandarmi &ndash; ma &Atilde;&copy; piu difficile a parlare italiano :).</li>
<li>THREE goes here.</li>
</ol><h2><a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></h2>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &acirc;&#128;&#156;pattern interrupt,&acirc;&#128;&#157; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &acirc;&#128;&#156;interruption&acirc;&#128;&#157; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>
