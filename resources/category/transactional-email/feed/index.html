<p>There are about six million articles on the Internet that offer <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">email marketing tips</a>. Most aren&rsquo;t very good. Read a few of them and you&rsquo;ll come away thinking that a subject line A/B test is the only thing standing between your little startup and an IPO.</p>
<p><span id="more-5817"></span></p>
<p>We have a different take on email.</p>
<p><strong>We believe email is about trust and two-way communication. </strong><em><a href="http://ctt.ec/dG9fU" target="_blank">Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</a></em></p>
<p>These ten counterintuitive email marketing lessons sum up nearly everything we believe (and know) about email. If this article makes you feel a little uneasy about your current strategy, good. That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<h2>1. Email isn&rsquo;t about selling.</h2>
<p>Do you watch TV for the commercials?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Do you check email for marketing newsletters?</p>
<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>Email isn&rsquo;t about selling. </strong>The primary reason people use email is to communicate with friends and co-workers. Secondarily, they use it to sign up for apps and services. (All social networks, for example, require an email address to create an account.) Receiving marketing materials is a side effect of using email for other reasons.</p>
<p>Despite all you&rsquo;ve heard about email as a channel, it&rsquo;s just a platform for communication. It&rsquo;s a great place to learn about what your leads and customers <em>want</em> and <em>need</em> but not necessarily the place to close deals.</p>
<p>Think about email as one piece of a multi-channel strategy where trust grows over time. Eventually, there is a tipping point but no single channel gets all the credit.</p>
<p>Aim for less noise:</p>

<h2>2. Email isn&rsquo;t that great at driving traffic.</h2>
<p>Since January 1, 2015, email has driven 12 percent of the total traffic to the Vero blog. Of that traffic, about 20 percent came from newsletters besides our own.</p>
<p>That accounts for nearly 50,000 visits. That&rsquo;s great but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the 130,000 organic search visits we&rsquo;ve earned over that same period.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wxoJJBmli6AfKGoBw6YG26tfE6eZNsKVY4Xh9phkHI/pubchart?oid=1901223879&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>If traffic is your primary goal, SEO has more potential than email. It scales faster and works for you 24/7.</p>
<p>Email does, however, drive targeted traffic. Because subscribers have opted-in to receive your emails, they are predisposed to like you and visit your site.</p>
<p>Our email traffic stays on the site for three minutes and one second on average, 67 percent longer than organic traffic (one minute and 48 seconds).</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wxoJJBmli6AfKGoBw6YG26tfE6eZNsKVY4Xh9phkHI/pubchart?oid=1918784050&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>What can we make of this data? SEO is a better source of new leads and email is better tool for nurturing relationships.</p>
<h2>3. Promotional email isn&rsquo;t a priority.</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the term <strong>email marketing</strong>?</p>
<p>Coupons? Sale this weekend? Another newsletter?</p>
<p>Email marketing is many things. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/promotional-emails/">Promotional email</a> is just one way it can be used to communicate with customers, subscribers, users and leads.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">analysis of 100 million emails</a>, we found that transactional emails have a click rate that is 42 percent higher than newsletters. For every 100 clicks you get on a newsletter, you get 142 on a transactional email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5840" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/transactional-email-click-rates-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="transactional-email-click-rates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?fit=800%2C600&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5840" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg" alt="transactional-email-click-rates" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/transactional-email-click-rates1.jpg?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>We also talked about the email sweet spot &hellip; that perfect place where emails are expected, contextual, personalized and relevant (i.e. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a>).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5841" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/email-marketing-sweet-spot-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=660%2C477&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="660,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email-marketing-sweet-spot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=660%2C477&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5841" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png" alt="email-marketing-sweet-spot" width="660" height="477" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=138%2C100&amp;ssl=1 138w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=75%2C54&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<p>Lifecycle emails should be your first priority. Promotional emails, subject line testing, button color A/B tests &hellip; that&rsquo;s all fine <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve laid a foundation of automated lifecycle emails.</p>
<p>If the graph above doesn&rsquo;t convince you, here&rsquo;s another way to think about it.</p>
<p>When you create a triggered lifecycle email, it works for you over and over again. Assuming your targeting is right, it arrives at the right time in the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/great-lifecycle-emails/">customer lifecycle</a> every time.</p>
<p>Compare that to promotional emails, which need to be created over and over again. And even if you segment your lists, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to send the right offer to every single person. It&rsquo;s essentially just guessing.</p>
<h2>4. Replies are a huge win.</h2>
<p>One conversion metric you might not be measuring is replies.</p>
<p>Here are two important things to think about:</p>
<p>First, people are likely already responding to your emails. If you aren&rsquo;t checking those responses, track them down. If you send a weekly newsletter to thousands of people, there is intel in those responses that can help you close leads and improve your content.</p>
<p>At Vero, we filter responses to our newsletter through <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/" target="_blank">Help Scout</a> so that we can assign the right team member to handle each one. Most responses are &ldquo;Out of Office&rdquo; replies but each week, we find a few people who need help getting started with Vero or have ideas for improving the newsletter.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5842" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/email-replies-vero/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?fit=760%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="760,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email replies vero" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?fit=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?fit=760%2C288&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5842" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg" alt="email replies vero" width="760" height="288" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?w=760&amp;ssl=1 760w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?resize=264%2C100&amp;ssl=1 264w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?resize=50%2C19&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-replies-vero.jpg?resize=75%2C28&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px"></p>
<p>Second, you can simply ask people to reply to your emails. Here&rsquo;s an example of an email we automate when new users start their first campaign:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5843" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/vero-ask-people-to-reply/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?fit=655%2C296&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="655,296" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero ask people to reply" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?fit=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?fit=655%2C296&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5843" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg" alt="vero ask people to reply" width="655" height="296" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=221%2C100&amp;ssl=1 221w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=50%2C23&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=75%2C34&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></p>
<p>Whatever you do, never send email from an address like &ldquo;noreply@business.com&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a surefire way to let your subscribers know it&rsquo;s a one-way conversation.</p>
<h2>5. You don&rsquo;t need to spend a fortune.</h2>
<p>We recently published case studies about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">TripAdvisor</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon&rsquo;s email marketing strategy</a>. As you might imagine, these companies are highly sophisticated and totally automated.</p>
<p>We got a lot of great feedback on those posts but one comment we heard over and over again was, &ldquo;Those are huge companies with massive marketing budgets. How can I send emails like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two comments on this point:</p>
<p>First, anyone can send triggered, personalized emails. Software like Vero starts at $99/month and has all the power you need to send emails like TripAdvisor and Amazon.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features/">Check out our features over here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Second, you don&rsquo;t build an email program like Amazon&rsquo;s overnight. It takes time. When people ask us where to start, our answer is always the same &ndash; at the beginning.</p>
<p>Onboarding is a great place to kick things off since you can get an ROI so quickly. In order, your first three triggered emails should be:</p>

<p>Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll have an automated email system working 24/7.</p>
<h2>6. Subject lines don&rsquo;t drive opens.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common myth that the subject line is what gets an email opened.</p>
<p>Sure, it factors in but <strong>emails get opened because of the rapport established between the sender and the recipient</strong>. <a href="http://ctt.ec/2VCkf" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<p>Take Alexis Madrigal&rsquo;s newsletter as an example. You won&rsquo;t find a lot of flash in his subject lines. That&rsquo;s because it isn&rsquo;t necessary. People subscribe to and open his newsletter because he sends it. They trust him. Readers like it, so they open the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Trust is scalable.</strong> <em><a href="http://ctt.ec/C9f5B" target="_blank">Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</a></em></p>

<p>Instead of asking, &ldquo;How can I get more people to open my emails?&rdquo; ask, &ldquo;How can I earn more trust?&rdquo; <a href="http://ctt.ec/Ke5V6" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this&ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<h2>7. Design is less important than you think.</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about sending beautiful, mobile-responsive emails. That&rsquo;s super important <em>if</em> you&rsquo;re sending HTML emails. Most of our best performing email campaigns are rich text. It&rsquo;s the perfect middle ground between plain text and HTML.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="608px"><img data-attachment-id="5849" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/rich-text-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=608%2C379&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="608,379" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rich text email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=608%2C379&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5849" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png" alt="rich text email" width="608" height="379" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?w=608&amp;ssl=1 608w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=160%2C100&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=75%2C47&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"></p>
<p>One problem with HTML emails is that there is too much emphasis on design. Rich text emails help you focus on writing for audience of one. <a href="http://ctt.ec/BO1j7" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a><em> (This is the single most important email copywriting tactic!)</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from our friend <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-templates-hurt-business/">Nathan Barry</a> on the topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best way to market online is to teach, to regularly deliver valuable content to your audience so that they will trust you and eventually want to purchase from you. So when you send an email, what part of the communication delivers the most value?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the content. <strong>So we should be stripping away everything else that isn&rsquo;t necessary in order to focus on the content.</strong> Multi-column layouts, background images, logos, and all the other nonsense that typically fills marketing emails doesn&rsquo;t deliver value to the recipient. Instead it is all about you, the sender. Flip that around and start delivering value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rich text emails can leverage some design, like buttons. A simple email with a bold button is a sweet spot for design. If you are looking for a quick way to increase click-through rates, this is a tactic you should try.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, rich text emails are mobile-friendly by default.</p>

<h2>8. Don&rsquo;t send emails on holidays or weekends.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a <em>good idea</em> to send timely emails but it&rsquo;s a <em>bad idea</em> to send emails when people don&rsquo;t want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Think about your favorite holiday, maybe it&rsquo;s Thanksgiving. It&rsquo;s a day for family and friends, not email. The truth is that your brand isn&rsquo;t important enough in your customers&rsquo; lives to email them on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>A note that says &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so thankful to have you as a customer&rdquo; takes away from their holiday. It&rsquo;s not timely, it&rsquo;s tacky.</p>
<p>The same goes for weekends. Even though <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">data will tell you open rates are steady over the weekend</a>, have some respect for down time. No one wants your email when they are trying to get away from screens for 48 hours to spend time with their family.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a timely email. Apple just announced a new MacBook and this email is being sent existing Gazelle customers. The context is built-in.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s an example of tacky email. Target is fishing for a few extra dollars at the risk of annoying their customers.</p>

<p>Understand the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I received a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/happy-birthday-email.jpg" target="_blank">&ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; email</a> from my student loan lender &hellip; the <strong>last</strong> people I want to hear from on my birthday. This fits perfectly into <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/03/what-brand-babblers-dont-understand.html" target="_blank">Bob Hoffman&rsquo;s brand babble</a> scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having a successful brand is very important to a marketer. But the idea that it is anything like that to a consumer is folly. Brand babble is just the faulty conflation of marketers&rsquo; needs and consumers&rsquo; interests.</p></blockquote>
<h2>9. The bigger the list, the worse the emails.</h2>
<p>So you have 100,000 people on your list? That&rsquo;s great, <em>unless</em> you are sending the same email to every single one.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Each of those 100,000 people has their own budget and their own buying motivations. Each is in a different place in the customer lifecycle. <strong>Sending the same message to all of them is a wasted opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>As the size of the list grows, so does the variety of people on it. Eventually, you are just targeting the &ldquo;average&rdquo; buyer and leaving out the majority of the people on the list. That&rsquo;s no way to build trust. You are the noise.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, you would send each of those 100,000 people a unique email. That&rsquo;s hard to do unless you automate the process.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid sending watered-down emails use external attributes to send super-personalized emails.</p>
<p><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/external-attributes/" target="_blank">See how Vero allows you to do this.</a></p>
<p>Check out this <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/" target="_blank">email from Airbnb</a>. We&rsquo;ve referred to it as the perfect behavioral email but it&rsquo;s actually not very hard to send.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi {First.name},</p>
<p>[insert data from browsing history]</p>
<p>[insert call to action]</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not the right fit, here are some other options.</p>
<p>[insert other listings in the same area and price range]</p></blockquote>
<p>Once the framework for an email like this is built, it can be automatically triggered over and over again. On a popular site like Airbnb, 100,000 emails might be triggered in just a few days. And each one is personalized, contextual and highly targeted.</p>
<p>Notice there is little reliance on design, copy or subject lines. It&rsquo;s <strong>all</strong> about context.</p>
<p>There is one important caveat to this. If people opt-in to a newsletter and that&rsquo;s all they receive, you can grow trust and audience simultaneously. Take Moz, for example, who send a bimonthly newsletter called the <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10" target="_blank">Moz Top 10</a>.</p>

<p>This works because the emphasis is on community and knowledge sharing. Moz is selling trust, not products.</p>
<h2>10. You can email people every day &hellip;</h2>
<p>&hellip; if they are expecting it.</p>
<p>Frequency is entirely dependent on the expectation the sender has set with the recipients. Digg, for example, offers an email every day so that&rsquo;s exactly what they deliver.</p>

<p>To be fair, many companies haven&rsquo;t set an expectation. So how often should they send emails?</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/" target="_blank">massive analysis</a>, we found that e-commerce businesses actually get more clicks on the second email of the week.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found that e-commerce businesses generally fared better when they sent multiple emails per week. One particularly high lift was the difference between one and two emails a week. On average, e-commerce customers saw an average click rate of 7.8% if they sent one email per week, while those that sent two saw an increase of 27% with an average click rate of 9.94%.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting. But don&rsquo;t let the data guide you down the wrong path. More is not always better, <em>even if the numbers initially indicate it</em>.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the recipients&rsquo; shoes. Do you really want 2-3 emails per week from one company? It&rsquo;s likely that a temporary increase in frequency will net you more conversions in the short term but it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Be careful not to falsely conclude that more is better. When it comes to frequency, it&rsquo;s better to earn and maintain trust rather than cannibalize your list.</p>
<hr><p>Were those tips counterintuitive enough? If you have another one, we want to hear it. Drop a note in the comments.</p>

<html><body><p><em>&ldquo;Your order has shipped!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you love receiving those emails?</p>
<p>I bet you open emails like that. I bet you click also. And I bet you even save them for reference.</p>
<p>Email marketers: Is a light bulb going off?</p>
<p>Instead of queuing up yet another promotional email blast, why not optimize an automated, repeatable process? We already know that people love <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/">transactional email </a> but few marketers address it. Instead, someone on the product team is sending the emails with the highest open rate. There&rsquo;s something wrong here!</p>
<p>Just the other day, I got this shipping confirmation email from <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/" target="_blank">Zazzle</a> (<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Zazzle_Shipping_Confirmation.jpg" target="_blank">view the full email here</a>). Now <strong>this</strong> is a great email.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t realize <strong>shipping confirmation emails</strong> could be sexy, did you?</p>
<p>Zazzle is automating a personalized, triggered, highly functional email that&rsquo;s nearly guaranteed to be opened. Can you say that about your email marketing?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at why exactly this email is so great.</p>
<h2>1. The email header matches the website header.</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the header in the email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5405" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/zazzle-email-header/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?fit=675%2C59&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="675,59" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle email header" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?fit=300%2C26&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?fit=675%2C59&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5405" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png" alt="zazzle email header" width="675" height="59" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?resize=300%2C26&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?resize=50%2C4&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-email-header.png?resize=75%2C7&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px"></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the header on the website.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5406" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/zazzle-website-header/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?fit=675%2C51&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="675,51" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle website header" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?fit=300%2C23&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?fit=675%2C51&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5406" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png" alt="zazzle website header" width="675" height="51" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?w=675&amp;ssl=1 675w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?resize=300%2C23&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?resize=50%2C4&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-website-header.png?resize=75%2C6&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px"></p>
<p>The consistency makes it very easy to find information and take action. The header also says something very important about Zazzle: you can shop, but you can also create things <em>and</em> sell things. It&rsquo;s a constant reminder that you can do more.</p>
<h2>2. It leads with the good stuff.</h2>
<p>People open these emails for the tracking number. While I always recommend adding context and value to transactional emails, don&rsquo;t ever hide what they came for. If it&rsquo;s a shipping confirmation email, give them the tracking number. If it&rsquo;s a receipt, give them the financial information. If you frustrate people, they&rsquo;ll learn not to trust you.</p>
<p>Zazzle offers a wealth of useful information immediately.</p>

<h2>3. They offer a coupon code.</h2>
<p>Did you know that it costs 7x more to <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/retaining-customers/" target="_blank">acquire a new customer</a> than it does to keep an existing one?</p>
<p>Zazzle spent a lot of time and money earning my business. The coupon code is a way to build on that momentum. I&rsquo;m having a good experience so far, the code is an opportunity to continue my journey. Strike while the iron is not.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="612px"><img data-attachment-id="5408" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/zazzle-coupon-code/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?fit=612%2C312&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="612,312" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle coupon code" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?fit=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?fit=612%2C312&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5408" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png" alt="zazzle coupon code" width="612" height="312" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?w=612&amp;ssl=1 612w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?resize=196%2C100&amp;ssl=1 196w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?resize=50%2C25&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zazzle-coupon-code.png?resize=75%2C38&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></p>
<h2>4. It alleviates anxiety.</h2>
<p>Uncertainty creates anxiety.</p>
<p>According to psychologist <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-and-sensibility/201308/uncertainty-anxiety-indecision-and-procrastination">Dr. Bill Knaus</a>, uncertainty occurs when &ldquo;you experience self-doubts as you hesitate with indecision&rdquo; and &ldquo;you procrastinate until you have a guarantee that you are safe to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why people come to your website but don&rsquo;t buy anything. You have created anxiety and failed to alleviate it.</p>
<p>Zazzle nails this in their email by offering lots of information. Customers won&rsquo;t need to contact customer support as often since this information is so easily accessible. It also helps build a trusting relationship between Zazzle and the customer. A foundation of certainty can lead to a long, healthy relationship.</p>

<h2>5. It has an unfair advantage: <strong>context</strong>.</h2>
<p>Here are questions that your customers, users and subscribers should be able to answer about every email you send:</p>
<ul><li>Why am I receiving this email?</li>
<li>How is this email valuable to me?</li>
<li>What should I do next?</li>
</ul><p>As the recipient of this email from Zazzle, I&rsquo;ll answer those questions.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Why am I receiving this email?</strong> <em>Because I purchased a product from Zazzle.</em></li>
<li><strong>How is this email valuable to me?</strong> <em>It has my tracking number.</em></li>
<li><strong>What should I do next?</strong> <em>Track the product, get help from customer service or use the coupon.</em></li>
</ul><p>Context is the most powerful tool you have. Use it.</p>
<h2>How to Start Sending Great Transactional Email</h2>
<p>First, you must accept that all emails are marketing emails. If it comes from your company or any of your employees, it&rsquo;s marketing. Even if it&rsquo;s not selling anything, it&rsquo;s marketing.</p>
<p>Now, do an email audit. Do you know what emails your customers are receiving? Many businesses use third parties to send invoices, receipts and reports. Make a list of <strong>every</strong> that is sent by or on behalf of your business.</p>
<p>Next, commit to sending just one great transactional email. Take a look at our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/transactional-emails/">guides for more inspiration</a>.</p>

<html><body><p>How are <strong>you</strong> going to become a better email marketer in 2015?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty out there on <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">email strategy</a> but the success of an email campaign largely depends on the skill and knowledge of the person executing it.</p>
<p>The tips in this post are things you can do improve yourself. Take ownership of your growth as a marketer and kill it this year. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>1. Create a swipe file.</h2>
<p>A swipe file is the best way to keep track of inspiration.</p>
<p>When you receive a great email, use Gmail Labels, Evernote or <a href="https://litmus.com/scope/" target="_blank">Litmus Scope</a> to save it for later. That way, you&rsquo;ll have a reservoir of inspiration when the time comes to write your next email.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><a style="background: #55acee; border-bottom-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 3px; border-radius: 4px; color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0; padding: 11px 20px 9px; text-decoration: none;" title="Tweet This Tip" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.twitter.com%2Fresources%2Fbuttons&amp;text=Email%20tip%20%231.%20Create%20a%20swipe%20file.%2024%20more%20here%3A&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.getvero.com%2Fmaster-email-marketing%2F&amp;via=getvero" target="_blank">Tweet This Tip</a></p>
<h2>2. Extend your email address for easy filtering.</h2>
<p>Did you know that you can extend your Gmail address? Just add a &ldquo;+&rdquo; then a keyword when subscribing to newsletters.</p>
<p>For example, I use &ldquo;jimmy+newsletters@getvero.com&rdquo; to subscribe to newsletters just for my swipe file. Then, I filter emails to that address to be marked as read, archived and labeled.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="328px"><img data-attachment-id="5323" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/master-email-marketing/gmail-extend/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?fit=328%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="328,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gmail extend" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?fit=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?fit=328%2C198&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5323" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=328%2C198" alt="gmail extend" width="328" height="198" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?w=328&amp;ssl=1 328w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=166%2C100&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=75%2C45&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><a style="background: #55acee; border-bottom-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 3px; border-radius: 4px; color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0; padding: 11px 20px 9px; text-decoration: none;" title="Tweet This Tip" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.twitter.com%2Fresources%2Fbuttons&amp;text=Email%20tip%20%232.%20Extend%20your%20email%20address%20for%20easy%20filtering.%2024%20more%20here%3A&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.getvero.com%2Fmaster-email-marketing%2F&amp;via=getvero" target="_blank">Tweet This Tip</a></p>
<h2>3. Subscribe to a lot of email newsletters.</h2>
<p>If you want to send great emails, it&rsquo;s a good idea to subscribe to tons of newsletters to 1) build up your swipe file and 2) see which tactics work and which really stink.</p>
<p>We created a list of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-email-newsletters/">50 great email newsletters here</a> but that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.

<h2>4. Signup for lots of products in your industry.</h2>
<p>Keep track of your competitors by subscribing to their emails and signing up for their product or service. Make sure you are receiving their newsletters and promotional email as well as their onboarding and lifecycle email.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to make a &ldquo;Competitors&rdquo; folder in <a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a> to keep track of their blogs and monitor Product Hunt for newbies in your field.</p>

<h2>5. Signup for lots of products NOT in your industry.</h2>
<p>I find that I&rsquo;m most inspired by emails sent by businesses outside the email industry. For that reason, I signup for all kinds of apps and service just to see what kind of emails they send.</p>
<p>Pinterest, for example, sends a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/saas-onboarding-emails/">great onboarding series</a> which has inspired our own onboarding emails.</p>

<h2>6. Write the world&rsquo;s best welcome email.</h2>
<p>Imagine that NASA is sending a rocket to the moon. If the rocket is one degree off at launch, it&rsquo;s going to miss the moon by a zillion miles. Their aim better be really good. (I&rsquo;m no scientist but you get my point.)</p>
<p>Your welcome email is the same way. Make it damn good so you end up on the moon and not Mars.</p>

<h2>7. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by A/B testing.</h2>
<p>If you were building a house, would you worry about what color to paint the bathroom before digging the foundation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing if you&rsquo;re A/B testing subject lines and button copy before building complete onboarding and lifecycle campaigns. Getting those in place is paramount to using email successfully.</p>
<p>Until then, A/B testing is simply a distraction.</p>

<h2>8. Practice copywriting in Hemingway App.</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t write like an English major, write like a journalist.</p>
<p>Business writing needs to clear, simple and succinct. &ldquo;Prose&rdquo; is never a word you should associate with marketing copy.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a> to keep you honest. This awesome tool helps you avoid run-on sentences, adverbs and big words.</p>

<h2>9. Send plain-text emails.</h2>
<p>Beautiful email templates are bad for your business. <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-templates-hurt-business/">Nathan Barry</a> explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best way to market online is to teach, to regularly deliver valuable content to your audience so that they will trust you and eventually want to purchase from you. So when you send an email, what part of the communication delivers the most value?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the content. So we should be stripping away everything else that isn&rsquo;t necessary in order to focus on the content. Multi-column layouts, background images, logos, and all the other nonsense that typically fills marketing emails doesn&rsquo;t deliver value to the recipient. Instead it is all about you, the sender. Flip that around and start delivering value.</p></blockquote>

<h2>10. Build a foundation of lifecycle emails.</h2>
<p>One of the many issues with promotional emails and newsletters is that you can only use them once.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">Lifecycle emails</a>, on the other hand, are used over and over again. This is awesome because you can do the work once and get value from it for a long time and you can actually optimize it since it will be triggered again soon.</p>
<p>Read Samuel Hulick&rsquo;s great post on Help Scout for a <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/blog/lifecycle-emails/" target="_blank">perfect explanation of lifecycle email</a>.</p>

<h2>11. Unsubscribe people before they do it themselves.</h2>
<p>Want to improve your open rates? Email people who actually care.</p>
<p>If someone hasn&rsquo;t opened your emails in six months, remove them from your list. Consistently sending emails that aren&rsquo;t opened is a good way to earn a reputation as a spammer.</p>

<h2>12. Do a survey.</h2>
<p>When people subscribe to the Vero blog, we send them 12-step email campaign over the course of about three months. Two of those emails are surveys that help us gather feedback about our content.</p>
<p>We have learned SO much from that survey. Much of the feedback is qualitative but it&rsquo;s hugely important to know who is reading our blog and what they think about it.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PTC8Z95" target="_blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PTC8Z95</a></p>

<h2>15. Go all-in on H2H.</h2>
<p>Speaking of Greg Ciotti, he has mastered the &ldquo;human-to-human&rdquo; writing tone.</p>
<p>Write emails like you are speaking to one person. Forget B2B and B2C. Focus on H2H.</p>
<p>When I get emails from Greg, I don&rsquo;t differentiate between personal and professional correspondence. Whether he sent the email just to me or to Help Scout&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/list-growth/" target="_blank">60,000 subscribers</a>, it feels the same because he uses a conversational tone.</p>
<p>Every email you send is personal. And every email you send is marketing.</p>

<h2>16. Read your emails out loud.</h2>
<p>Baremetrics founder Josh Pigford recently started turning his <a href="https://baremetrics.io/blog" target="_blank">blog posts</a> into a podcast called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/founders-journey/id957952675">Founder&rsquo;s Journey</a> simply by reading them out loud.</p>
<p>This is incredibly smart because it&rsquo;s an easy way to repurpose content but it&rsquo;s also a great way to hone your writing. After seeing this, I started reading my emails and blog posts out loud before publishing them.</p>
<p>It gives you a whole new perspective on how your writing is actually received. (Thanks for the inspiration Josh.)</p>

<h2>17. Treat onboarding like a newborn baby.</h2>
<p>Most parents don&rsquo;t leave their newborn babies outside overnight to toughen them up. Instead, they cater to their every need &ndash; feeding them at all hours of the day and night, changing their diapers and taking lots of pictures to remember those special moments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much exactly how you should treat your <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/saas-onboarding-emails/">onboarding</a>.</p>
<p>When someone news signs up, use onboarding emails to gently coo them from a wide-eyed newborn to an ass-kicking customer.</p>

<h2>18. Tell people exactly how often to expect emails.</h2>
<p>Setting expectations is really important with email marketing. If someone signs up for your weekly newsletter but you send emails three times a week, they are going to unsubscribe.</p>
<p>Tell people upfront how often they should expect to receive emails.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Product Hunt sets expectations for their (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/product-hunt/">addictive</a>) daily email:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="464px"><img data-attachment-id="5330" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/master-email-marketing/product-hunt-signup/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?fit=464%2C127&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="464,127" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="product hunt signup" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?fit=300%2C82&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?fit=464%2C127&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5330" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?resize=464%2C127" alt="product hunt signup" width="464" height="127" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?w=464&amp;ssl=1 464w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?resize=300%2C82&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?resize=50%2C14&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt-signup.png?resize=75%2C21&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<h2>19. Use the 1-2-3 Method.</h2>
<p>When email fails, it&rsquo;s often because the sender didn&rsquo;t make it abundantly clear what the recipient should do next. The 1-2-3 Method (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/1-2-3-method/">explained in greater detail here</a>) ensures that will never happen again.</p>
<p>The 1-2-3 Method looks like this:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Twitter-Lifecycle-Email.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do next:</p>
<ul><li>Thing 1</li>
<li>Thing 2</li>
<li>Thing 3</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>You can only choose three things so make them count!</p>

<h2>20. Use the Inverted Pyramid Method.</h2>
<p>The Inverted Pyramid Method is a good way to ensure that your emails aren&rsquo;t distracting.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a &ldquo;too many cooks in the kitchen&rdquo; situation, help stakeholders focus on the purpose of email marketing. Design, copy and content can actually interfere with email marketing! Use this guide minimize distractions and send tight, focused emails.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/inverted-pyramid-method/">See some examples here.</a></p>

<h2>21. Commit to sending one really great behavioral email.</h2>
<p>I know, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/convert-with-behavioral-email/">behavioral email</a> is intimidating if you aren&rsquo;t a techie. But let me assure you that I&rsquo;m no techie and even I can send behavioral emails.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in e-commerce, start with an abandoned shopping cart email.</p>
<p>If your in SaaS, start with a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/retention-emails/?hvid=2Nz47">retention email</a>.</p>

<h2>22. Create a personal newsletter.</h2>
<p>I did this recently as an experiment and am already learning some important lessons. (You can subscribe here: <a href="http://swipefile.co/" target="_blank">SwipeFile.co</a>.)</p>
<p>For example, when you aren&rsquo;t the founder of a business, you can sometimes hide behind a veil of anonymity. Maybe you create emails that are &ldquo;sent&rdquo; from your CEO or maybe you create emails that are just &ldquo;from&rdquo; the company.</p>
<p>When the email is yours and yours alone, you pore over every word in hopes of perfecting your email. Ownership of an email will help you learn to write like a human and send way better emails at your day job.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://goodbits.io/">Goodbits</a>, <a href="http://curated.co/">Curated</a> and <a href="http://tinyletter.com/" target="_blank">TinyLetter</a> to see how easy curation can be. Additionally, you can create a second project in Vero to keep professional and personal email separate.</p>

<h2>23. Use buttons.</h2>
<p>If you want the recipient of your email to click, use a button.</p>
<p>Buttons work.</p>
<p>Here is some <a href="http://www.codeshare.io/52MBX" target="_blank">simple HTML</a> to use the button below.</p>
<p><a style="background: #83c000; border-bottom-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 3px; border-radius: 4px; color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0; padding: 11px 20px 9px; text-decoration: none;" title="Learn more about buttons" href="http://www.copyblogger.com/call-to-action-buttons/" target="_blank">Learn more about buttons</a></p>

<h2>24. Don&rsquo;t give up.</h2>
<p>Just like content marketing, email marketing needs time.</p>
<p>You need to grow a list, earn their trust, build an onboarding series, create <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a> and so much more. It takes a long time. Don&rsquo;t give up when the going gets tough.</p>

<html><body><p><em><strong>&ldquo;A life cycle is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>The term <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle marketing</a> infers that customers experience a contiguous, sequential process that does <em>not</em> end. Taken literally, this means that when a customer makes a purchase, they&rsquo;ve reached the end of a cycle and are ready to begin again.</p>
<p>In practice, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/">email receipts</a> mark the end of that cycle. Too often, however, they fail to start it again. Besides serving as a proof of purchase, the receipt, like all other <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a>, should move the user to the next step.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, we teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/adii" target="_blank">Adii Pienaar</a>, creator of <a href="https://receiptful.com/" target="_blank">Receiptful</a>. His mission is to make receipts a serious sales tool. With Shopify and WooCommerce integrations in place (and more on the way), Receiptful makes it incredibly easy to send great receipts (and it&rsquo;s free).</p>
<p>Adii and I looked at three different email receipts and each took a turn dissecting them. Have a thought on these emails or a better way to send receipts? Drop a note in the comments.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png"><img data-attachment-id="5254" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-receipts/etsy/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?fit=848%2C1488&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="848,1488" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Etsy Email Receipt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?fit=171%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?fit=584%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5254" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png" alt="Etsy Email Receipt" width="848" height="1488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?w=848&amp;ssl=1 848w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?resize=171%2C300&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?resize=584%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 584w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?resize=57%2C100&amp;ssl=1 57w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?resize=28%2C50&amp;ssl=1 28w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Etsy.png?resize=43%2C75&amp;ssl=1 43w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"></a></p>
<h3>Adii&rsquo;s Take</h3>
<p>Etsy is a marketplace where artisans and craftspeople can sell their unique goods. In that sense, Etsy already has a challenge with their email receipts, as it needs to be generic enough for all of their sellers and should communicate Etsy and the seller&rsquo;s brand identity.</p>
<p>On the receipt&rsquo;s first impression, the minimalist and clean design style makes it clear that it&rsquo;s an Etsy receipt. The top-half of the receipt however is just &ldquo;average&rdquo; &hellip; nothing really engages me or makes me want to scroll down further.</p>
<p>Towards the bottom of the receipt though, Etsy does two things really well:</p>
<ol><li>They provide you with more info about the seller. In this example, the seller uses a photo of themselves, which further humanizes this interaction and creates more of a personal connection. In tandem with the email subject line (<em>&ldquo;Your Etsy Purchase from oohlalajanie (168835142)&rdquo;</em>), it is clear that you&rsquo;ve purchased an item from both Etsy and an individual seller.</li>
<li>Even though the &ldquo;More items from&hellip;&rdquo; section could be emphasized more, the individual product visuals are fantastic and definitely draw me in.</li>
</ol><h3>Jimmy&rsquo;s Take:</h3>
<p>These email is a lesson in utility.</p>
<p>Every email receipt delivers information about the transaction itself but Etsy really takes it to another level with buttons to contact the seller, related products and even a map to show you where the seller is located. <strong>Context is king when it comes to email.</strong></p>
<p>Receipts often fail because businesses treat them as the end of the customer&rsquo;s lifecycle. Your marketing strategy worked! The customer moved through the funnel just like you wanted. Time to start all over!</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already spent time and money acquiring this customer. This is your opportunity to up the ante by creating a great customer experience and making it incredibly easy for the customer to buy again.</p>
<p>This email does a great job offering the next step instead of saying goodbye.</p>
<h2>2. Warby Parker</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5255" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-receipts/warby-parker/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?fit=680%2C2040&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="680,2040" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Warby Parker Email Receipt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?fit=100%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?fit=341%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5255" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png" alt="Warby Parker Email Receipt" width="680" height="2040" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?resize=100%2C300&amp;ssl=1 100w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?resize=341%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 341w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?resize=33%2C100&amp;ssl=1 33w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?resize=17%2C50&amp;ssl=1 17w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warby-Parker.png?resize=25%2C75&amp;ssl=1 25w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></p>
<h3>Adii&rsquo;s Take:</h3>
<p>Warby Parker is an American brand of prescription eyeglasses and sunglasses. They design all of their glasses in-house and it&rsquo;s evident that they apply that same design-focused attitude to their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>This example isn&rsquo;t strictly a receipt &hellip; more of an order confirmation email. That said, online vendors can learn so much about how to captivate a reader in a seemingly mundane email.</p>
<p>How do you feel when you see this email?</p>
<p>I immediately feel excited about the glasses that are on their way and I relive the excitement I felt when I picked out these items. This is also emphasized with the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Excited!&rdquo; copy, which fuels the positive vibes.</p>
<p>The receipt includes very little copy and instead relies on great imagery to do the selling. The product front-and-center. In that sense, Warby Parker doesn&rsquo;t rely on fancy marketing speak or tactics to achieve a marketing goal; it just allows its products to do its own talking.</p>
<h3>Jimmy&rsquo;s Take:</h3>
<p>This email is just cool.</p>
<p>First, it looks great. As Adii mentioned, they invest a lot in design so why not showcase it in their emails? After all, it&rsquo;s the reason the customer went to the site and placed an order in the first place.</p>
<p>The little bit of copy in the email sets the tone for an upcoming brand experience: the Home Try-On.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Just for you</strong></p>
<p>Just like fingerprints, no two Home Try-Ons are alike. Congratulations on picking out a unique specimen. It will be on its way to you soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>This helps build excitement for the arrival of the product. I also like that they included links to their social media sites. The links are passive &ndash; there are no strong calls to action &ndash; but for the right customers, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to stay engaged with the brand in between buying cycles.</p>
<h2>3. ASDA</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="584px"><img data-attachment-id="5261" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-receipts/asda-email-receipt-1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?fit=584%2C1584&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="584,1584" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="ASDA email receipt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?fit=111%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?fit=378%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5261" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg" alt="ASDA email receipt" width="584" height="1584" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?w=584&amp;ssl=1 584w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?resize=111%2C300&amp;ssl=1 111w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?resize=378%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 378w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?resize=37%2C100&amp;ssl=1 37w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?resize=18%2C50&amp;ssl=1 18w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ASDA-email-receipt-1.jpg?resize=28%2C75&amp;ssl=1 28w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></p>
<h3>Adii&rsquo;s Take:</h3>
<p>ASDA is a British supermarket chain that is owned by Walmart. In the last couple of years, ASDA has invested heavily in their e-commerce efforts and have reported double-digit growth in e-commerce sales for the past year.</p>
<p>The receipt above is exclusively from their online store and it has not yet been implemented as the digital alternative to their current paper in-store receipts.</p>
<p>That said, the receipt makes a very solid first impression and I especially like how their appreciation for my purchase is emphasized right at the start of the receipt. Whilst I intuitively know that I&rsquo;m just another number in their books, it does make me feel better about purchasing from the store.</p>
<p>The best part of the receipt is the advertisement that they&rsquo;ve included about their &ldquo;Price Guaranteed&rdquo; campaign (where they offer to match the the price of any item that you can get cheaper elsewhere). The advertisement in itself is generic and not tailored to the individual receiving the receipt, but it does two things really well:</p>
<ol><li>It forms part of a greater marketing strategy, which means the inclusion thereof in the receipts adds further awareness about the offer; and</li>
<li>By including in at the top and bottom of the receipt, they&rsquo;re essentially doubling the exposure and impact of the advertisement.</li>
</ol><h3>Jimmy&rsquo;s Take:</h3>
<p>ASDA could suddenly make receipts relevant again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always boggled my mind that grocery stores offer membership programs but don&rsquo;t send email receipts (or other meaningful promotions).</p>
<p>Paper receipts are an afterthought these days &hellip; no one saves them because they aren&rsquo;t very useful. An email receipt, on the other hand, can offer some immediate value before being archived.</p>
<p>ASDA does a nice job promoting their Price Guarantee program without annoying the customer. There&rsquo;s even a subtle upsell: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve forgotten something, don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s still time to change your order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope they bring this to their retail locations soon. Email receipts will be a gamechanger for brick and mortar stores.</p>
<h2>5 Ways to Upgrade Your Email Receipts</h2>
<ol><li>Where possible, humanize the seller by showing photos of team members and / or sharing interesting, biographical data.</li>
<li>Include recommendations for similar products.</li>
<li>Be as visual as possible and put the products on center stage.</li>
<li>Broadcast and share in the emotion of the buyer i.e. &ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Excited!&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Consider including the same marketing messaging in two positions on the receipt (top and bottom) to maximize the likelihood that the customer will take action.</li>

<html><body><p>The success of your onboarding flow relies heavily on the first few touches. The welcome email should be actionable, informative and clear. The examples in this post cover a range of approaches. Some might work great for your business, other might not. Testing, as always, is highly encouraged.</p>
<h2>The Purpose of Welcome Emails</h2>
<p>One important thing to remember about welcome emails is that open and click rates are the wrong metrics to measure. Of course, you&rsquo;ll want to tweak subject lines and body copy to maximize impact but the real purpose the welcome email is to move users through your onboarding process. The next step, depending on your software, blog, store, etc. could be encouraging users to complete their profile, download something, read your docs or something else entirely. Whatever that step is, it <strong>must</strong> deliver value.</p>
<p>The metric to measure is the conversion rate. How many people took the step you asked them to take?</p>
<p>With this in mind, let&rsquo;s dive into the examples.</p>
<h2>1. Airbnb</h2>
<p>Uncertainty is a conversion killer. New users usually want to know how your product or service works before diving in. This <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/">Airbnb email</a> alievates anxiety by providing an overview the booking process. Then, instead of asking people to &ldquo;Book Now&rdquo;, it prompts them to &ldquo;Search Now&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s non-commital and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">friction-free</a>.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/airbnb-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>2. Amazon</h2>
<p>Amazon is massive company. Sure, it&rsquo;s mostly based on e-commerce but their welcome email needs to tell new users about other things too. For example, there&rsquo;s a big emphasis on digital content in this email, probably because the margins are higher than physical products.</p>
<p>Think strategically about the call to action in your welcome email. Instead of driving customers towards popular products or content, drive them to high margin products and high converting content.</p>

<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/amazon-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>3. Basecamp</h2>
<p>Basecamp&rsquo;s singular goal in this email is to get the user signed in. They trust that the product will sell itself. The email is simply a bridge from the inbox to the app. If your product is great, that&rsquo;s all you need.</p>
<p>They mention in the email that 1.5 million other organizations are using Basecamp. That&rsquo;s a massive number and a great use of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/#4">social proof</a>.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/basecamp-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>4. Beatrix</h2>
<p>The emphasis on taking action is what makes this <a href="http://beatrixapp.com/" target="_blank">Beatrix</a> email work. The brief introduction tees up the call to action: Create a &ldquo;New Assistant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Creating the assistant is what will actually make the software valuable to the user. The sooner that happens, the sooner a free trial user becomes a paying customer.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/beatrix-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>5. BugHerd</h2>
<p>Now known as <a href="https://macropod.com/">Macropod</a>, this welcome email from founder Alan Downie is personal and simple. It sets the tone for the kind of experience you can expect when using the product. It might seem counterintuitive at first but this is one of the best ways to brand yourself to new users because of how it makes them <em>feel</em> &hellip; like they are a person, not a &ldquo;user&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bugherd-welcome-email.png" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>6. Buzzsumo</h2>
<p><a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">Buzzsumo</a> takes a similar approach with their plain-text welcome message. The difference, however, is that Buzzsumo is focusing on getting product feedback. They offer a number of ways to get in touch, which is key to getting people to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; on their goal.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/buzzsumo-welcome-email.png" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>7. Ello</h2>
<p>Ello&rsquo;s welcome email aligns perfectly with the rest of their branding &hellip; a unique typeface, lots of white space and little copy. The Ello experience is the same in the email as it is on the site. The welcome email bridges that gap nicely.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ello-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>8. Fab</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on this welcome email from Fab but they make it work by making the email look great &ndash; the design is really beautiful &ndash; and using upbeat copy. Just look at some of the words they use:</p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;discover fun, colorful products&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Smiles. Guaranteed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We promise you will love your Fab purchase.&rdquo;</li>
</ul><p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a nice experience and there are a number of ways to engage with the site directly from this email.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/fab-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>9. Goodreads</h2>
<p>The 1-2-3 formula is a good one for welcome emails. Just like the Airbnb example above, Goodreads show the user how easy it is to get started. The 1-2-3 formula is easy for readers to digest and, when done well, reduces anxiety about using a new product.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/goodreads-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>10. iDoneThis</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the most functional welcome email I&rsquo;ve ever seen. <a href="https://idonethis.com/" target="_blank">iDoneThis</a> users receive a daily email that looks almost exactly like this one. Replying with the tasks you accomplished that day adds your &ldquo;dones&rdquo; to your calendar. The welcome email explains how this works then gives you the opportunity to try it right away.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iDoneThis-welcome-email.png" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>11. Import.io</h2>
<p>If your software requires that users download something, it&rsquo;s imperative that they take action as soon as possible. Without that download, your product is worthless to them. This email could emphasize the download more but overall, I like the way it&rsquo;s broken into sections with brief instructions accompanying each.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/import.io-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>12. Inbox by Gmail</h2>
<p>Because <a href="http://www.google.com/inbox/">Inbox</a> is a new concept to most users, Gmail has taken the &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo; approach to their welcome email. It&rsquo;s likely that some users still don&rsquo;t quite understand how it works. The video, along with the six questions and answers, make it clear how the product works and gets users excited to try it out.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/gmail-inbox-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>13. JustUnfollow</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="px">This is as simple as the 1-2-3 approach gets. <a href="https://www.justunfollow.com/" target="_blank">JustUnfollow</a> uses as few words as possible to describe what users need to do and links to the appropriate places in their app. Often, less is more and that&rsquo;s definitely the case here.<br><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/just-unfollow-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>14. Lonely Planet</h2>
<p>This is the first example featuring a coupon code. This a popular and easy way to encourage new customers to take action. Lonely Planet does a nice job building exciting in the intro paragraph, then incentivizing immediate action with the coupon code.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/lonely-planet-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>15. Squarespace</h2>
<p>Like the Basecamp example above, Squarespace is confident that their product will do the selling for them. Their welcome email focuses entirely on getting new users signed in and the customer service plug at the end is like a safety net for people who might be intimated by the process.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/squarespace-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>16. Strava</h2>
<p>Yet another example of the popular 1-2-3 method, this Strava email does a great job explaining what the app does and why users should use it. It fails, however, to include a strong call to action. A button asking users to login or record their first workout would make it near-perfect.</p>

<h2>17. SumAll</h2>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve said all along, you need to understand how your users get value so you can move them in the right direction. For SumAll, the key is getting new folks to connect other services so the data collection can begin. The contrasting colors and the strong copy make the call to action extremely effective.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sumall-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>18. SumDay</h2>
<p>This welcome email is remarkably similar to the SumAll email in that new users must take action to get value from the product. Without adding funds, the service is simply worthless. Waiving the fee is just like using a coupon code to incentive action.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sumday-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>19. Target</h2>
<p>For some reason, huge companies often think they need huge emails. They don&rsquo;t. In fact, the customers would be better served by short, actionable emails. This welcome email from Target is too busy but it does a few things right:</p>
<ol><li>Uses positive, upbeat copy.</li>
<li>Offers savings in exchange for immediate action.</li>
<li>Has a picture of a dog. (Any excuse to use a picture of a dog, cat, koala bear or baby is a good one.)</li>
</ol><p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/target-welcome-email.jpg" alt="" class="example-email" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>20. Vero</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: I wrote this email, but I really do think it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>This is the email people got when they signed up for our holiday email course. The goal was to get them to spread the word, so we made sharing as easy as possible. We employed Noah Kagan&rsquo;s Samuel L. Jackson email hack, which you can <a href="http://okdork.com/2014/06/18/the-samuel-l-jackson-marketing-hack/">read more about here</a>.</p>

<h2>21. Zapier</h2>
<p>This email is welcoming users to <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>&lsquo;s free plan, meaning their trial has expired. I like it because it&rsquo;s turning what could be the end of the customer lifecycle into the beginning of something new and exciting. If you have an excuse to turn a negative event into a positive one, take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Any tips for welcome emails you&rsquo;d like to share? Let us know in the comments.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/02/27-marketing-tips-thatll-woo-your-visitors-and-win-them-over/" target="_blank">27 Marketing Tips That&rsquo;ll Woo Your Visitors and Win Them Over</a></strong></p>
<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>6. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/guest-blogging" target="_blank">How We&rsquo;ve Reached More Than 1 Million People by Guest Blogging</a></strong></p>
<p>Is your time better spent writing for your own blog or someone else&rsquo;s? Rand Fishkin calls guest blogging a slippery slope, since you are giving away authority that could be your own. Groove&rsquo;s Alex Turnbull, however, suggests otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234689" target="_blank">10 of the Most Counterintuitive Pieces of Advice From Famous Entrepreneurs</a></strong></p>
<p>Advice from founders is invaluable, especially when it&rsquo;s really off the beaten path. Beth Belle Cooper asked 10 entrepreneurs for their most counterintuitive advice and uncovered some fascinating insights. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These days, however, I live without goals, for the most part. It&rsquo;s absolutely liberating, and contrary to what you might have been taught, it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop achieving things.</p>
<p>It means you stop letting yourself be limited by goals.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/improve-your-email-marketing-today/">6 Ways You Can Improve Your Email Marketing TODAY</a></strong></p>
<p>Why wait until tomorrow? Here are some very actionable tips you can put to good use right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Create an inbox swipe file.</li>
<li>Find every customer touch point.</li>
<li>Send an A/B test.</li>
<li>Learn to write better copy.</li>
<li>Segment your lists.</li>
<li>Upgrade your toolbox.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><strong>10. <a href="http://blog.leadpages.net/landing-pages-apple-borrow-apples-best-copywriting-techniques-copy/" target="_blank">Landing Pages by Apple</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for tips on creating landing pages that convert like crazy, why not look at one of the most successful companies in the world? Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about craftsmanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about placing you, the customer, squarely in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong>11. <a href="http://blog.qz.com/post/82007790924/how-we-doubled-our-email-sign-up-rate-by-reducing" target="_blank">How we doubled our email sign-up rate by reducing friction</a></strong></p>
<p>This post appeared on Quartz, one of my favorite sites, a few months ago but it&rsquo;s a great reminder that reducing friction is one of the best ways to drive conversions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since we rolled out the new system on February 19, our daily subscriber rate has doubled, even on weekends when activity dips considerably. Users can now sign up via &ldquo;in-stream units&rdquo; (pictured above) or through the Daily Brief landing page. Of the people that view that page, a full 60% of them now go on to subscribe. In the chart below, you can see the noticeable effects these small tweaks have made to our growth.</p>

<p><strong>12. <a href="http://sparksheet.com/secret-social-network-ama-reddits-erik-martin/" target="_blank">The Secret Social Network: AMA with Reddit&rsquo;s Erik Martin</a></strong></p>
<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>13. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/lean-email-marketing/">Minimum Viable Email: A New Approach Email Marketing</a></strong></p>
<p>Last but not least, take a look at a new way to approach email. We call it lean email marketing, after the now-famous lean startup model popularized by Eric Ries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The product must be both minimal &ndash; requiring the least effort to create &ndash; and viable &ndash; functional enough that users can provide useful feedback. Rather than spending time and money perfecting a product, the lean approach gives entrepreneurs the chance to get rapid feedback, fail fast and improve quickly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since marketers don&rsquo;t always have quick access to good designers, it&rsquo;s important to be able to cobble together your own visuals. Luckily, there are some resources that make this <em>really</em> easy. Ritika Puri offers up a list of killer resources in this post.</p>

<p>Good design is important for many reasons, especially conversions. The right colors and images can move readers through a funnel quickly. Bad design can mean lost leads and lost business. Payman Taei breaks it down in this awesome post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to optimizing your website for conversions, visual elements on your page play a huge role. By visual, I mean color, images, cues and their placement on your landing or checkout pages.</p></blockquote>

<p>How can marketers possibly balance personalization with privacy? Personalization, by its very nature, requires data that consumers are increasingly less willing to give. Unless, of course, they 1) trust the brand or 2) are adequately bribed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances. Cash, points and deals were the top reasons given for being willing to do so, according to the survey. Nonetheless a striking 42 percent said &ldquo;nothing would motivate me to share personal information with companies.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed. It&rsquo;s bad news for poorly run companies, as consumers are about twice as likely to share bad customer experiences.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Have you ever considered that your blog post or email is actually a performance? Think about it: Many people will see and read that post or email. Some will love it, and some might hate it. Still others might be bored by it. The results of your performance are measured in clicks, page views and shares. When you think about it like that, marketing starts to seem really intimidating.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email really from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends.

<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Email is changing <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old technology &ndash; MIT&rsquo;s Ray Tomlinson sent the first email in 1971 &ndash; that is experiencing an identity crisis.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, many services have cropped up that claim they will change email forever. The proliferation of mobile devices has made email easier and faster to access. Office workers everywhere swear email is the root of their their stress and low productivity. There are even blogs dedicated to helping people manage their email.</p>
<p>As the world&rsquo;s reliance on technology has increased, so too has the noise. The result is shorter attention spans and, sometimes, disdain for email.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always this way and it won&rsquo;t remain this way for long. Email began as an alternative to snail mail but has evolved into a supercharged hodgepodge of text messaging, social networking and bulk mail. It&rsquo;s not pretty and it presents some interesting challenges for email marketers.</p>
<p><span id="more-3538"></span></p>
<p>While our collective frustration with &ldquo;email overload&rdquo; has led some to declare email dead, there is hope. And the future is bright, assuming marketers continue the shift <em>away</em> from selling and <em>towards</em> personalized media creation.</p>
<p>At Vero, we spend a lot of time thinking about email&rsquo;s place in our lives. This thinking guides the development of our software and ensures that our tool is making email better not just for our customers, but their customers too. Here are a few of our thoughts on the future of email, along with action items you can put to use today.</p>
<h2>1. Data will reign supreme.</h2>
<p>Think about how <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/6-lessons-you-can-learn-from-amazons-killer-email-marketing/" target="_blank">Amazon does email marketing</a>. Now, compare that to how the average business does email marketing. There&rsquo;s a <em>huge</em> divide.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s culture of innovation is one reason the company is so successful. That attitude has led them to rely heavily on data to understand what makes their customers buy, buy again and buy some more. What&rsquo;s interesting is that Amazon has access to many of the same tools as the rest of us. They have simply chosen a more aggressive approach to their marketing. Here&rsquo;s Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on a 2011 shareholder call:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you invent frequently and are willing to fail, then you never get to that point where you really need to bet the whole company. [Amazon Web Services] also started about six or seven years ago. We are planting more seeds right now, and it is too early to talk about them, but we are going to continue to plant seeds. And I can guarantee you that everything we do will not work. And, I am never concerned about that&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;. We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also noted on the call that &ldquo;ninety-plus percent of the innovation at Amazon is incremental.&rdquo; The company is driven by data, testing and more data. They use this <em>exact</em> strategy on their email marketing as well.</p>
<p>This type of thinking is spreading as the tools marketers need become cheaper and more accessible. The result is more effective emails.</p>
<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait to start collecting data on your customers. There are so many tools available to help you understand more about behavior and conversion. Besides Vero, which allows you <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/">track behavior and trigger emails</a>, here are two of our favorite tools:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/" target="_blank">KISSmetrics</a>: Person-based analytics platform that identifies site visitors and tracks them over time.</li>
<li><a href="https://sumall.com/" target="_blank">SumAll</a>: Tool for compiling data from Google Analytics, social networks, ad networks and shopping cart platforms.</li>
</ul><h2>2. Personalization will take on a meaning.</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3540" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/future-of-email-marketing/personalized-email-800/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?fit=763%2C215&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="763,215" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="personalized-email-800" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?fit=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?fit=763%2C215&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3540" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png" alt="personalized-email-800" width="763" height="215" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?w=763&amp;ssl=1 763w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?resize=300%2C85&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?resize=50%2C14&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/personalized-email-800.png?resize=75%2C21&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px"></p>
<p>This is what personalization means today but that&rsquo;s changing fast.</p>
<p>All the data marketers are collecting theoretically allows them to send unique emails to every lead and customer. That is true personalization but few spend the time to make it happen. Event tracking tracking and triggered email technology is making it much easier to do this.</p>
<p>With enough data and the right software, you can customize emails in the same way an algorithm decides which search results to show you. Based on <strong>[this data]</strong>, <strong>[this context]</strong>, <strong>[these past results]</strong> and <strong>[these similar customers]</strong>, you can send the perfect email. Now <em>that</em> is personalization.</p>
<p>In the future, personalization might be algorithmic email or mass customization. Whatever we call it, personalization will go much deeper than it does today.</p>
<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>Start expanding your campaigns today. If you have campaigns for new leads, hot leads and new customers, start branching those out to encompass more of the data you already have. For example, a campaign for new customers could be segmented into simple categories to speed up the onboarding process:</p>
<ul><li>new customers with more than $1 million in ARR</li>
<li>new customers with more than $10 million in ARR</li>
<li>new customers with more than $25 million in ARR</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s basic personalization but these customers have unique needs and should be treated accordingly.</p>
<h2>3. A/B testing will fade away.</h2>
<p>When I first read <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/10/mass-persuasion-one-user-at-a-time.html" target="_blank">Nir Eyal&rsquo;s thoughts</a> on why A/B testing will die out, I scoffed. After some reflection, however, I can see that his thinking is right on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, companies are able to test messaging in real-time, trying dozens of variants to discover which ones create the desired behavior most efficiently. But so-called &acirc;&#128;&#156;A/B testing,&acirc;&#128;&#157; <strong>which is designed to find the best solution for the average user</strong>, is rapidly being replaced by far more sophisticated methods designed to optimize on an individual, per-user basis.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Finding the best solution for the average user means finding the optimal solution for almost no one.</strong> This is another reason that algorithmic email or mass customization will be the best form of personalization in just a few years.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t explain this as eloquently as Nir, so here is another excerpt from his article <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/10/mass-persuasion-one-user-at-a-time.html" target="_blank">Mass Persuasion, One User At A Time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By singling out one persuasion strategy per person, companies are addressing customers in the way that best suits the user. In the age of increasing personalized data and a greater understanding of the tools of persuasion, companies will no longer need to communicate with customers as an amalgam of an &acirc;&#128;&#156;average user&acirc;&#128;&#157; that doesn&rsquo;t actually exist. Instead, by marrying psychology and customer data, smart companies will give customers more of what they want: someone who speaks their language.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>Start planning new ways to test calls to action on your leads and customers. To get meaningful data on a user, you need to test different methods against the same user.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to explore what makes users. If you have, for example, a free trial of your product, you can use a series of very different calls to action to convert them. Start with the one you think is most powerful and if they don&rsquo;t convert, try something else. When they finally convert, you will know what it is that made them take action.</p>
<ul><li>Email #1: offer a discount on the product (the user values money)</li>
<li>Email #2: offer additional features (the user values powerful tools)</li>
<li>Email #3: provide testimonials and/or case studies (the user values security)</li>
</ul><p>Keep track of which email converted the user. It will definitely come in handy in the future.</p>
<h2>4. Email volume will decline.</h2>
<p>There were 838 billion marketing emails sent in 2013. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank">That&rsquo;a huge number.</a></p>
<p>How many of them converted a lead into a customer? And how many were utterly ignored because they spoke to the &ldquo;average&rdquo; user and not actually the recipient?</p>
<p>There is a lot of noise in our lives. Email is just one of many things seeking our attention. In order for email to be effective at all, it has to be highly personalized and timely. Blasting emails out because &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t effective now and will be less so in the future.</p>
<p>While the data says that email volume will increase steadily over the next few years, we believe that users will actually see less email than ever. More email ends up in the spam folder than ever before and new tools like Gmail&rsquo;s inbox tabs make it very easy to ignore annoying email. The result for users is less clutter and less noise. The challenge for marketers is getting seen.</p>
<p>In order for email marketing to remain effective, marketers will need to leverage data, personalization and testing to find out what works for every individual that ends up in their database. The result will be less marketing email but much higher quality.</p>
<p><strong>Action item:</strong></p>
<p>If you are sending bulk emails because you aren&rsquo;t sure what converts or haven&rsquo;t spent time collecting data about your users, it&rsquo;s time to embrace a new approach to email. Here are a few ways to start small that will gradually help improve your conversion rates:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Segment customers by every possible data point.</strong> This includes purchase history, the source of the lead, past interaction with your email. You should also keep updated segments for ideal customers, new leads and lapsed customers. Keeping segments up-to-date, or using software that does it for you, is the first step to better email.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on quality.</strong> Consider hiring a professional copywriter to write your emails. Compare conversion rates to your current rates to find out if it produces an ROI. Sending fewer, high quality emails is the fastest and easiest way to pay for help from a pro.</li>
<li>Follow the golden rule: &ldquo;Treat others as you wish to be treated.&rdquo; In email marketing words, don&rsquo;t send an email that you wouldn&rsquo;t be excited to see in your own inbox.</li>
</ul><p>Do you have any predictions for the future of email? We&rsquo;d love to hear them, just let us know in the comments.</p>

<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s time we welcome a new era of email marketing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bulk&rdquo; email is gone and it&rsquo;s not coming back. Our technology is too good for it and our attention spans are too short for it. With all the noise out there, your emails have to seriously rock to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>Luckily, every marketer has access to the tools they need to take email to the next level. What&rsquo;s often needed is simply a change in perspective.</p>
<p><span id="more-3479"></span></p>
<h2>The Mindset for Email Marketing Success</h2>
<p>The old email marketing mindset looked something like this:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="400px"><img data-attachment-id="3492" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-marketing-2-0/old-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="old-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3492" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg" alt="old-email-marketing" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Bulk email is as effective as the junk mail you throw away before even opening. Since it&rsquo;s not personalized or data-driven, it&rsquo;s a race to the bottom. It&rsquo;s expensive and highly ineffective. There is a better way!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your new <strong>email marketing 2.0</strong> mantra:</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t market to the the lowest common denominator. Use data and personalization to reach the right people at the right time.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>With this new guiding principle burned into your mind, you can begin to examine exactly how to approach your content, copywriting, subject lines, campaigns, segments and calls to action.</p>
<h2>An Introduction to Big Data for Email Marketers</h2>
<p>The key to email marketing 2.0 is data. It didn&rsquo;t used to be accessible and easy to use, which is exactly how your inbox got flooded with all that junk. Marketers just guessed. Times have changed, though, and now every marketer has access to tools that can make data easy to collect, analyze and act on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, that you run an e-commerce business. You have a database of customers and their purchases. You have another database that you use for your email newsletter where you send occasional updates about your product or company. Besides that, you have some Twitter followers, a Facebook fan page and an active blog.</p>
<p>Many of the same people interact with you on these different channels but because the databases can&rsquo;t communicate with each other, you have no idea what <em>exactly</em> is driving your sales. If someone clicks a link in your newsletter to a blog post, then views a product page but doesn&rsquo;t actually make a purchase until two days later when they click a link in a tweet, <strong>you can&rsquo;t track it</strong>.</p>
<h2>A New Mindset = Better Email and More Sales</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s approach this scenario from the email marketing 2.0 angle. Here&rsquo;s how the situation might be different.</p>
<p>You write a blog post and schedule an email for your subscribers. Some of these people have already made purchases while most have not. You segment the list and send it to your customers first. They get early access to your content, which makes them feel good and gives you feedback so you can tweak the content before sending it to the list of non-customers (which is much larger). Non-customers get an email with a link to the same post.</p>
<p>Once the email is sent, visitors start showing up to read your post. On the blog, you are A/B testing two calls to action. One asks visitors to download an e-book while the other suggests more content they might like (and that you <em>know</em> converts).</p>
<p>Throughout the blog, you mention and link to products. As visitors check out these products, you are tracking events in your database. For customers who are logged in, you know exactly which products they are looking at and how they got there. When a customer views the same product page twice in one week, you have an email that automatically triggers showing them a testimonial about the product and offering 5% off if they buy within 24 hours.</p>
<p>For the rest, you are tracking them with cookies and gathering data which you can later attribute to a customer profile once they make a purchase. Using a re-marketing tool like <a href="http://www.perfectaudience.com/">PerfectAudience</a>, you can show them ads for the products they&rsquo;ve viewed on your site when they head off to Facebook, Twitter and other sites.</p>
<p>With each new blog post and email, you collect more and more data that shapes the way you construct your landing pages, product pages, what content you write and how often you email them. No email is ever a &ldquo;blast&rdquo;. Each has a purpose that can be tracked and improved on.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to email marketing 2.0.</strong></p>

<h2>All In: How to Get Started with Email Marketing 2.0</h2>
<p>In a matter of minutes, you can get the tools you need to make this kind of marketing a reality. While we obviously recommend Vero, there are a few other platforms with this capability that you can check out. Whichever platform you choose, here are some tips to get you started.</p>
<h3>The Obvious Tips</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Add more value than ever.</strong> Moreso than ever, value is the name of the game. When I look around at some of the best emails I get, they deliver massive value. Take HelpScout for example. Their content is <em>so good</em> that it would never cross my mind to delete one of their emails. That weekly newsletter is my gateway to learning something profound about customer support. A reputation like that isn&rsquo;t earned overnight but their hard week has payed off big time. Their newsletter now boasts more than 50,000 subscribers.Whether the newsletter itself or the content it links to is great, make sure the people on your email list can&rsquo;t get enough.</li>
<li><strong>Go mobile.</strong> I know, everyone is sick of hearing this one. It&rsquo;s so obvious. Still, 48 percent of emails are opened on a mobile device and just 11 percent of marketing emails are optimized for mobile (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">source plus more stats</a>). There&rsquo;s a huge disconnect in the way marketers <em>talk</em> about mobile and <em>execute</em> on a mobile strategy. Spend the time to either design a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/html-email-templates/">mobile responsive HTML email template</a> or buy a great template. In a pinch, you can always send a plain text email too.</li>
<li><strong>Take it one step at a time.</strong> You aren&rsquo;t going to be able to implement a data-driven, personalized email strategy in one day. Start by importing your contacts and segmenting them as much as you can. A really good campaign moves people dynamically from one campaign to another based on their behavior so spend time outlining your customer lifecycle and matching the appropriate emails with the right people and time.</li>
</ul><h3>The Not-So Obvious Tips</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Take personalization to the next level.</strong> Including someone&rsquo;s first name in an email is a great start but as you collect more data, personalization can be so much more powerful. Event tracking is where personalization gets really interesting. When you track events, like a SaaS user failing to login for two weeks, you can automatically trigger emails based on the size of their business, annual revenue, number of employees and past usage history. For most marketers, this would take the place of no communication at all, so it&rsquo;s nearly guaranteed to drive more sales and user engagement.</li>
<li class=" small-image" style="px"><strong>Perform an email audit.</strong> Here is a classic email marketing problem. A company sends promotional emails that few people open and read but sends transactional emails &acirc;&#128;&#148; receipts, notifications, welcome notes, etc. &acirc;&#128;&#148; that lots of people read and open. The issue is that transactional emails are opened at up to 8x the rate of promotional emails yet they have little to no marketing value.The key is finding the sweet spot. An email that people need and actually want to open but that also moves them closer to a sales goal.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/making_email_better_sweet_spot1.png" alt="Triggered email sweet spot">Your transactional emails are likely sent by a third party, so they accomplish a function but do nothing for your marketing efforts. Find every email that your customers could possibly receive from you or on your behalf and start optimizing them. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/transactional-email/">You can read A LOT more on transactional email here.</a></li>
<li><strong>A/B test like your life depends on it.</strong> Take advantage of every opportunity to run an A/B test. This holds true for emails, where you can test subject lines, &ldquo;from&rdquo; addresses, body copy, calls to action, plain text vs. HTML, time of day, day of the week and a number of other factors. You can also A/B test:
<ul><li>article headlines with <a href="http://kingsumo.com/apps/headlines/?hvid=2r28g8" target="_blank">KingSumo Headlines</a></li>
<li>landing pages with <a href="http://unbounce.com/" target="_blank">Unbounce</a> and <a href="http://www.leadpages.net/" target="_blank">LeadPages</a></li>
<li>your entire website with <a href="https://vwo.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Above all, the key to killing it with email is to <strong>think big</strong>. What&rsquo;s your next move? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/retention-email-inspiration">Retention emails</a> are the lowest-hanging fruit of the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to increase your lead velocity rate and optimize your conversion to bring on new customers. Inactive users have already gone through that process and you&rsquo;ve already invested time and money in them. They see value in your product and, at some point, were ready to become a customer.</p>
<p><strong>Turning inactive users into active users is one of the easiest ways to generate revenue.</strong></p>
<p>As our CEO Chris Hexton wrote on the <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/03/20/examples-retention-emails/">CrazyEgg blog</a>, <strong>retention equals revenue</strong> and email is the best way to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if you&rsquo;re acquiring the right sort of customers and activating them rapidly it&rsquo;s super important to continue to monitor customers that go inactive and to prompt them to come back and use your software or purchase again. <strong>To maximize retention, spend a lot of time ensuring your customers don&rsquo;t leave.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>We took a look at five retention emails to see what keeps users engaged and what makes them forget about you. Check them out here, along with our five tips for creating killer retention emails below.</p>
<p><span id="more-3445"></span></p>
<h2>1. RunKeeper</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3443" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/runkeeper-activation-email/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?fit=806%2C884&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="806,884" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="runkeeper-retention-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?fit=274%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?fit=806%2C884&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3443" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png" alt="runkeeper-retention-email" width="806" height="884" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?w=806&amp;ssl=1 806w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?resize=274%2C300&amp;ssl=1 274w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?resize=91%2C100&amp;ssl=1 91w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?resize=46%2C50&amp;ssl=1 46w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/runkeeper-activation-email.png?resize=68%2C75&amp;ssl=1 68w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px"></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that fitness apps have become so popular. They do two things really well:</p>
<ol><li>Help people set goals, track progress and become healthier</li>
<li>Make us feel guilty when we don&rsquo;t exercise <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol><p>There is a lot of emotion tied to self-confidence and body image. When <a href="http://runkeeper.com/" target="_blank">RunKeeper</a> emails their users to reactivate them, they are asking for so much more than logging data in their app.</p>
<p>RunKeeper faces an interesting challenge. If their users don&rsquo;t go out running on a regular basis, they have no reason to use the app. In order to keep user engagement high, RunKeeper actually has to focus on motivating people to exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enviable position in some ways. People <em>know</em> they should be exercising and they <em>know</em> that using RunKeeper can help them lose weight and run faster. Both parties agree that app usage is a good thing. Instead of begging users to login and use their app, RunKeeper simply reminds users that getting back into an exercise routine is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Rocks</strong></p>
<ul><li>The subject line &ldquo;We miss you!&rdquo; &ndash; strikes just the right tone. It makes me feel like I am part of a community. It also makes me feel a bit guilty for not contributing to the community recently. Whichever emotion it elicits for you, it gets the email opened.</li>
<li>There isn&rsquo;t much copy in this email &ndash; just 24 words before the button &ndash; but RunKeeper is able to get me excited about exercising again. And they make it seem <em>so easy</em>. Just look at the language they use:
<ul><li>&ldquo;Great fitness habits start with small routines&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see progress in no time!&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The call to action &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in&rdquo; &ndash; is perfect. The implication is clear: this is a tribe of motivated, healthy people and we want YOU to join us.</li>
<li>The inclusion of social media links is also a good idea, since RunKeeper can use these channels for daily motivation.</li>
</ul><h2>2. Mint.com</h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png"><img data-attachment-id="3444" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/mint-retention-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?fit=797%2C1309&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="797,1309" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mint-retention-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?fit=183%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?fit=623%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3444" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png" alt="mint-retention-email" width="797" height="1309" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?w=797&amp;ssl=1 797w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?resize=183%2C300&amp;ssl=1 183w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?resize=623%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 623w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?resize=61%2C100&amp;ssl=1 61w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?resize=30%2C50&amp;ssl=1 30w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mint-retention-email.png?resize=46%2C75&amp;ssl=1 46w" sizes="(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a>&lsquo;s challenge is similar to RunKeeper&rsquo;s in that users <em>know</em> the software can lead them down a path of prosperity. The key is keeping them on task. This email from Mint is just loaded with motivation, inspiration and information.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Rocks</strong></p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing all the buzz&rdquo; &ndash; This makes me feel left out again. The tribe mentality is powerful and Mint is wise to play on that. It&rsquo;s a strong way to start this email.</li>
<li>I like all the links in the top of the email. There are five links before the first line of copy. For users who don&rsquo;t need any convincing to log back into Mint, it&rsquo;s easy to head to the website and get started again.</li>
<li>Just in case you have any doubt that Mint is the right tool &ndash; some users could have been testing Mint&rsquo;s competitors &ndash; this email contains three testimonials and three endorsements. I like that they have included testimonials from regular people as well as reviews from well-respected publications.</li>
<li>And if users still aren&rsquo;t sure, there are lots of smaller steps they can take. Earning a new Twitter follower or app user is a step in the right direction, even if it doesn&rsquo;t immediately get the user logged in and using Mint again.</li>
</ul><h2>3. AppFog</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3447" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/retention-emails/appfog-retention-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?fit=809%2C1076&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="809,1076" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="appfog-retention-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?fit=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?fit=770%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3447" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png" alt="appfog-retention-email" width="809" height="1076" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?w=809&amp;ssl=1 809w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=770%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 770w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=75%2C100&amp;ssl=1 75w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=56%2C75&amp;ssl=1 56w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px"></p>
<p>The first two emails were examples we should all strive to emulate but not every retention email is so effective. <a href="https://www.appfog.com/" target="_blank">AppFog</a> missed an important opportunity with this message. This email is different, however, because the stakes are higher. If I don&rsquo;t login to my account, I lose it. Yet there isn&rsquo;t a single link to a login page in this email!</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Needs Work </strong></p>
<ul><li>Email marketers: You can&rsquo;t tell users the email is friendly when in fact it&rsquo;s not. This email is way too long and complicated. There are four different dates mentioned, multiple activation options and no clear call to action.</li>
<li>This email could really benefit from a button. If you want people to login, <strong>make it as easy as possible</strong>. There isn&rsquo;t even a link to login page, let alone a clear direction for the user to take.</li>
<li>This email is frustrating in many ways but the biggest mistake is that it never reminds the user of the <strong>value</strong> of the their AppFog account. I used AppFog to make a sandbox for learning HTML and CSS. It has been enormously useful for me but nowhere in this email am I reminded of how this product can help me.</li>
</ul><h2>4. ProjectFlow</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3449" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/retention-emails/projectflow-retention-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?fit=807%2C614&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="807,614" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="projectflow-retention-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?fit=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?fit=807%2C614&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3449" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png" alt="projectflow-retention-email" width="807" height="614" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?w=807&amp;ssl=1 807w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=131%2C100&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=75%2C57&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px"></p>
<p>Why send an email without a call to action, especially when user engagement is so crucial to your business? <a href="https://www.projectflowapp.com/" target="_blank">ProjectFlow</a> made similar mistakes to AppFog by sending a vague, forgettable email. If you want people to take action, make it dead simple.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Needs Work</strong></p>
<ul><li>As the email states, I haven&rsquo;t logged into ProjectFlow in <strong>six months</strong>. At this point, I&rsquo;ve completely forgotten what the product is and why I signed up in the first place. This email could really benefit from some some screenshots, a video demo and a testimonial. Without a reminder of the value of the product, I have no reason to consider using it.</li>
<li>There is no clear call to action in this message. I understand they want me to login but there is no link or button to help me do it. This is one hundreds of emails I received that day. Since it doesn&rsquo;t capture my attention and encourage me to take action, it&rsquo;s forgotten.</li>
<li>One thing that retention emails should always avoid is a backup plan. Don&rsquo;t tell people they must login then offer an alternative. Decide what action they should take and use the entire email to emphasize it. It feels like they are saying goodbye to me rather than welcoming me back:<br><blockquote><p>For users who don&rsquo;t log in again in the next 7 days, we&rsquo;ll be closing your account on August 12. You can always sign up again later if you&rsquo;d like to give ProjectFlow another try. Thanks for trying ProjectFlow the first time around!</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Links to social media channels, blogs and customer success stories aren&rsquo;t backup plans, they are small steps towards a bigger goal. If the user isn&rsquo;t ready or willing to login immediately, offer other ways for them to stay connected. Then, you can use those platforms to keep them moving in the right direction.</li>

<p>Let&rsquo;s end this article on a positive note. <a href="http://www.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Weebly</a> killed it with this one.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Rocks</strong></p>
<ul><li>Weebly takes the customer support approach to this email. Not understanding how to use an app is one of the primary reasons users don&rsquo;t login and use products, even if they like the software. Offering help is an easy and inviting way to get people engaged.</li>
<li>Just like RunKeeper and Mint, Weebly makes me feel wanted by letting me know they miss me. Using words like &ldquo;we&rdquo; reminds users they aren&rsquo;t alone. There is a community of people like them who wish they would come and participate.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Auto Login&rdquo; button and link are awesome. Thank you, Weebly, for making it easy to take action.</li>
<li>The links to the social sites and blog are subtle but useful. Any opportunity to get users to follow you on other platforms is a good idea.</li>
</ul><h2>5 Tips for Killer Retention Emails</h2>
<ol><li><strong>Choose one call to action</strong> and use the entire email to emphasize it.</li>
<li><strong>Use buttons and deep links.</strong> Telling people to login without giving them an avenue to actually do it is a waste of time.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it concise.</strong> Use the copy to imply value, not convince people to take action. Don&rsquo;t waste space and attention with words that don&rsquo;t directly relate to your call to action.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid backup plans.</strong> Don&rsquo;t tell you users &ldquo;You must login or lose your account,&rdquo; then say &ldquo;But you could always make a new account later.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s confusing and will only distract users who might otherwise login.</li>
<li><strong>Create a sense of urgency.</strong> Giving users a timeframe to act can be a very powerful way to re-activate them. Don&rsquo;t frame it as an ultimatum though, just use time as a tool to keep them moving.</li>
