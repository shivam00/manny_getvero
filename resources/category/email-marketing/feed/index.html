<html><body><p>Using dynamic content you can personalize your email and push notifications to create more relevant and engaging customer experiences. With Vero, you can use the Liquid templating language, and it&rsquo;s full support for dynamic content to personalize your messages.</p>
<p>Liquid offers a huge amount of flexibility to customize the data you already send to Vero, and it often saves you from syncing additional data to your Vero account &ndash; helping you keep things simple, tidy and easy to keep track of. It means you can send data to Vero in exactly the format it&rsquo;s tracked, and easily transform it at the message level to create the most relevant content for your customers.</p>
<h2>Learning Liquid</h2>
<p>To help you get started with Liquid, we&rsquo;ve released <a href="https://www.getvero.com/email-personalization-liquid-guide">a guide to personalizing email and push messages using Liquid</a>. You may already be a pro with Liquid, but it might come in handy as a quick reference or to share with new team members, to help them get up to speed.</p>
<p>The Liquid guide gives you:</p>
<ul><li>An intro to Liquid and how it works</li>
<li>A summary of the most commonly used Liquid tags and filters for email and push messages</li>
<li>Examples of how you can use Liquid</li>
<li>Vero-specific Liquid shortcodes</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s just the top level stuff for now, but we&rsquo;ll continue to add more advanced Liquid functions and examples to the guide over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any suggestions or examples that you&rsquo;d like us to cover in our next update.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.getvero.com/email-personalization-liquid-guide">the guide</a> and improve your customers&rsquo; experience today.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Learn how to load weather, location and other data via APIs into the body of an email and use that data to personalize what a customer will receive.</p>
<p>This is an example of a welcome email campaign (perhaps a little exaggerated!) that includes details about the weather at the recipient&rsquo;s location, a map of their city and details on their nearest Vero support contact (based on our support team members in the US, EU, and Australia).</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s so special about personalizing emails with data loaded from APIs?</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s special here is that the data being loaded and the decisions on which content to render and how to render it is handled <strong>at send time</strong>. The data is loaded dynamically in real time for each individual recipient &ndash; this is a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re an engineer, a product manager or a marketer, you&rsquo;ve probably encountered one of these scenarios:</p>
<ol><li>You need to access data for your emails but that data <strong>changes frequently</strong> (product inventory, latest product releases, price changes) and this data is only pushed into your email marketing tool on a daily basis or when customers happen to log in.</li>
<li>You need access to data for each individual user and that data needs to be (or is best) <strong>generated</strong> &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; (dynamic coupons, an invite code, a map).</li>
<li>You need access to data that is the result of a <strong>complex algorithmic</strong> or analytic process (user-level recommendations, counts on large data stores, etc.).</li>
<li>You have an internal API you&rsquo;ve <strong>already built</strong> out that contains all of the user data you might want in order to personalise an email, but writing middleware to push this data into an email tool is complex, unwarranted or will result in data being out of sync with the internal API.</li>
<li>You can combine internal data already in your email tool with <strong>data loaded directly from a third party</strong> (weather, another vendor) to get the desired result, saving you building your own middleware.</li>
</ol><p>If so, <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion">Fusion</a> is a solution we&rsquo;ve built to help ensure you&rsquo;ve got access to the data in all of the scenarios above.</p>
<p>We think Fusion is pretty special in helping us help you achieve your personalization goals.</p>
<h2>How we set this up</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://github.com/getvero/fusion-welcome-email">HTML of the email</a> we&rsquo;re using in Vero to build out this example.</p>
<p>This file is made up of two main components.</p>
<h3>1. Loading in the required data</h3>
<p>Vero uses the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers">Liquid</a> templating language in order to customise email content.</p>
<p>One of Liquid&rsquo;s most powerful features is the <code>capture</code> function (<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers#variable-assignment">more here</a>). In this example we&rsquo;re using a combination of Vero&rsquo;s custom <code>fetch_json</code> method, which loads a remote <code>JSON</code> data feed into the outgoing email and the Liquid <code>capture</code> function in order to load all of the data we&rsquo;ll use in the body of the email.</p>
<p>As a first step, we&rsquo;ll use Fusion in conjunction with <a href="https://clearbit.com">Clearbit</a> in order to load the user&rsquo;s demographic data. We&rsquo;ll then use <code>capture</code> to store the user&rsquo;s city and country in a format we can use with weather and mapping APIs.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Get information about the user from Clearbit --&gt;
  {%fetch_json clearbit = 'https://REDACTED:""@person.clearbit.com/v1/people/email/{{user.email}}'%}

  &lt;!-- Set the location variable as we want to use it for other API requests (and in the copy!) --&gt;
  {%capture location%}{{json.clearbit.geo.city}}, {{json.clearbit.geo.country}}{%endcapture%}
</code></pre>
<p>This will output something like <code>Sydney, Australia</code> for my test user (<code>chris@getvero.com</code>).</p>
<p>We then build on this by using a combination of a weather API to get the current weather data in the user&rsquo;s city.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Get weather data --&gt;
  {%fetch_json weather = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={{location}}&amp;amp;APPID=REDACTED'%}
</code></pre>
<p>These are some nice, clean examples of using Vero&rsquo;s Fusion functionality and some of Liquid&rsquo;s basic functionality. We use the data we&rsquo;ve fetched above to insert a map, which Google cleverly lets us do in a raw <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center={{location}}&amp;amp;zoom=14&amp;amp;size=600x250&amp;amp;key=REDACTED&amp;amp;markers=color:red|{{location}}"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We also use it to insert the weather and a weather icon.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;At Vero, we're all about personalisation. In this email we wanted to show you a little of what's possible. For example, when we sent you this email we could see that it was &lt;strong&gt;{{json.weather["main"]["temp"]}}&Acirc;&deg;F&lt;/strong&gt; with you &acirc;&#128;&#147;&nbsp;"{{json.weather.weather.first.description}}" according to the weather report! &lt;img src="http://openweathermap.org/img/w/{{json.weather.weather.first.icon}}.png"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>To really show off what Liquid rendering can do when it comes to personalisation given the full power of a JSON feed at your command, the final part of our example results in simple content output displaying how far the user who has signed up is from our a local support team member at Vero but uses some complex logic.</p>
<p>To do this we: </p>
<ul><li>We <code>assign</code> an array with three of our top locations with support team members.</li>
<li>We use Google&rsquo;s Distances API to get the distance of each support member in the above array from the user who has signed up. This results in either a distance result in miles, where Google can find the distance (generally requires a road connection in order to work!) or nothing.
<p>        <!-- Get distances --></p>
<pre><code>  {%fetch_json distances = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&amp;amp;origins={{location}}&amp;amp;destinations=Seattle,USA|Brisbane,Australia|Amsterdam,Netherlands&amp;amp;travelMode=Driving&amp;amp;key=REDACTED'%}
        </code></pre>
</li>
<li>We iterate through the three possible options and find the minimum distance (i.e. the closest team member).
<p>        <!-- Find local support contact --></p>
<pre><code>  {%assign min_value = 0%}
          {%assign min_index = 0%}
          {%for row in json.distances.rows.first.elements%} 
            {%unless row.status == 'ZERO_RESULTS'%}
              {%if forloop.index0 == 01%}
                {%assign min_value = row.distance.value%}
                {%assign min_index = forloop.index%}
              {%elsif forloop.index0 != 01 and row.distance.value &lt; min_value%}
                {%assign min_value = row.distance.value%}
                {%assign min_index = forloop.index%}
              {%endif%}
            {%endunless%}
          {%endfor%}
          {%assign actual_index = min_index|minus:1%}
        </code></pre>
</li>
<li>We assign the index of that team member in the assigned array, so that we can refer to the details of the array later.</li>
</ul><p>This then enables us to print out the city of the closest support representative and how far away that is in miles:</p>
<pre><code>As we mentioned, we're based all over the world. One reason for this is we want to provide our customers with the best support possible. From where you are, your nearest support contact is based in {{json.distances.destination_addresses[actual_index]}} &acirc;&#128;&#147; that's <strong>{{json.distances.rows.first.elements[actual_index].distance.text}}</strong> away! We've got team members in Australia, the Netherlands and the USA to help out when it comes to support.
</code></pre>
<p>The result is a super personal email that has been built <strong>on the fly</strong> by Vero&rsquo;s rendering engine, thanks to the power of APIs and Liquid.</p>
<h2>Try it yourself</h2>
<p>You can learn more about <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion">Fusion here</a>.</p>
<p>To get this example set up in your own account:</p>
<ol><li>Sign up to a Vero <a href="https:///app.getvero.com/signup">trial account</a></li>
<li>Add at least one test user in your account &ndash; you can easliy do this by using Vero&rsquo;s <a href="https://help.getvero.com/articles/import-a-list-of-customers-via-csv.html">CSV importer</a>. You will want to ensure that this test user is a valid business user for which Clearbit returns valid data.</li>
<li>Sign up to <a href="https://clearbit.com">Clearbit</a>, the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap API</a> and check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google&rsquo;s API</a>.</li>
<li>Create a new draft campaign (try a <em>Newsletter</em> to get started).</li>
<li>Use the <em>Custom HTML</em> layout and copy in the example HTML we&rsquo;ve provided.</li>
<li>Save the email and use the <em>Preview in browser</em> function to fully render an example version of the email (make sure you preview <em>as the test user</em> in order to render things correctly).</li>
<li>Voila!</li>
</ol><p>Remember: bad emails feel &ldquo;clunky&rdquo;. Great emails:</p>
<ul><li>inform your customers</li>
<li>make sense based on their other interactions with your business, and</li>
<li>are &ldquo;just another part of your customer experience&rdquo;.</li>
</ul><p>To make an email great, you need data. Not only data about who your customer is, but data about their touch points with your business, data that relates to their location or position, or data related to your business (new releases, inventory, metrics, etc.). Fusion is a powerful tool that will help you achieve this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>2015 was the year of the newsletter.</p>
<p>Tools like Curated, Goodbits and TinyLetter made it easier than ever to start a newsletter. Many people took advantage of these great tools and began building lists and curating content.</p>
<p>The problem?</p>
<p>These tools don&rsquo;t suddenly make people care about what you have to say. Marketers, the chief offenders of bad emails, took it too far this year. Most newsletters flopped, whether the creators are willing to admit it or not.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why most newsletters fail along with some suggestions on sending email that actually works.</p>
<h2>They don&rsquo;t start at the beginning.</h2>
<p>Most newsletters send recent posts to subscribers. Regardless of when the subscriber joins, everyone receives the same information at the same time. Dropping a reader into the content slipstream is the easiest way to send a newsletter, but it&rsquo;s certainly not the best.</p>
<p>A new visitor to your site lacks context. How has your blog evolved? How do you help people succeed? What do other readers know that they don&rsquo;t?Answering these questions goes a long way towards earning loyal readers.</p>
<p>New subscribers to the Vero blog receive a six-step campaign. The first email welcomes the new subscriber and shares the Vero blog &ldquo;Hall of Fame.&rdquo; These aren&rsquo;t our most-trafficked posts, they are the highest-converting posts.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="573px"><img data-attachment-id="7437" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/why-most-newsletters-fail/screenshot-2015-12-30-11-19-22/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2015-12-30-11.19.22.png?fit=573%2C442&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="573,442" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screenshot 2015-12-30 11.19.22" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2015-12-30-11.19.22.png?fit=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2015-12-30-11.19.22.png?fit=573%2C442&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7437" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2015-12-30-11.19.22.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-12-30 11.19.22.png" width="573" height="442" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2015-12-30-11.19.22.png?w=573&amp;ssl=1 573w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2015-12-30-11.19.22.png?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px"></p>
<p>Next, we send a series of five emails explaining how we can help them succeed. We offer content as well as tips for using our app to send better emails. Within the first few days of subscribing, we send four emails. We want to provide the most useful information we can while the reader&rsquo;s curiosity is piqued. After this campaign ends, subscribers simply receive our normal weekly newsletter.</p>
<p>Our strategy isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it&rsquo;s worked well. More than 50% of the early emails are opened. That&rsquo;s more that double our weekly newsletter.</p>
<p>New readers need different information. Tailor their initial experience with a simple campaign to get them up to speed as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>There is a disconnect between the audience and the content.</h2>
<p>This problem isn&rsquo;t unique to email marketing, but it&rsquo;s the reason many newsletters go unread. People subscribe to newsletters for information that will help them succeed in their work or personal life. Promotion, therefore, falls on deaf ears.</p>

<p>This is the exact reason <a href="/resources/email-is-thriving">email can&rsquo;t be viewed as a channel</a>. Email can be used to build relationships at scale, but it requires that marketers move away from a &ldquo;channel&rdquo; mentality and towards a &ldquo;user experience&rdquo; mentality. That may seem like a subtle difference, but it results in completely different messaging. Marketers that view email as a channel gravitate towards blast emails and promotions. They burn through lists without regard for the subscribers needs or wants. Marketers that focus on user experience deliver content that helps the subscribers succeed. They, in turn, are rewarded with loyal customers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s what ad man <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/03/what-brand-babblers-dont-understand.html" target="_blank">Bob Hoffman calls</a> &ldquo;brand babble&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Modern marketing is operating under the delusion that consumers want to interact with brands, and have relationships with brands, and brand experiences, and engage with them, and co-create with them.</p>
<p>Sorry, amigo. Not in this lifetime.</p></blockquote>
<p>Make sure the content of your emails is what your readers need. Without empathy, your email is doomed to fail.</p>
<h2>It&rsquo;s sent too often or not often enough.</h2>
<p>Creating a publishing schedule is a positive constraint that results in <a href="http://www.jimmydaly.com/big-wins/" target="_blank">big wins for your business</a>. This starts by setting an expectation during the signup. If you promise an email every day, you better send one every day. And if you promise one every month, you can&rsquo;t send one every week.</p>

<p>A schedule is the key to creating habitual readers. They must know when to expect your emails or your results will be wildly inconsistent. If you plan to test subject lines and calls to action, send time is a variable you need to consider. Make a promise to your readers and keep it.</p>
<h2>Users don&rsquo;t actually ask for them.</h2>
<p>Email marketing is the pinnacle of permission-based marketing. This means you have the privilege, not the right, to communicate with prospects, leads and customers. It&rsquo;s the #1 reason we see email marketers fail and the #1 reason we see them succeed. As <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin says</a>, it&rsquo;s all about building trust and earning respect.</p>
<blockquote><p>It recognizes the new power of the best consumers to ignore marketing. It realizes that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re sending your newsletter to trial signups who didn&rsquo;t explicitly request your emails, you&rsquo;re breaking that trust.</p>
<p>Respect the inbox, deliver value and you can succeed.</p></body></html>

<p class="lead">Most email marketing happens before the sale, but that&rsquo;s just the beginning of the customer lifecycle. The most successful businesses send their best emails after the signup, purchase or conversion.</p>
<p>Creating <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a> require that marketers look at the whole customer, not just the sale. I was reminded of this after making a recent purchase from <a href="https://www.meundies.com/">MeUndies</a>. The post-purchase emails are surprisingly pleasant &ndash; it&rsquo;s the right blend of clear copy, sharp design and personalization. The tone and style that I liked so much from my pre-purchase days is still there, but the messaging has changed to meet my new needs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to look at the entire lifecycle to understand how MeUndies is communicating with customers and driving sales. I&rsquo;ve separated the emails into pre- and post-purchase categories to make it a little easier to see the whole picture.</p>
<p>If you like these emails as much as I do, give <a href="https://twitter.com/meundies" target="_blank">@MeUndies</a> a shout-out on Twitter.</p>
<h2>Before the Purchase</h2>
<p>Style blog <a href="http://www.racked.com/2015/11/17/9745864/meundies-underwear-shopping-fun-boxers-thongs">Racked</a> calls MeUndies&rsquo; marketing &ldquo;irreverent,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s certainly been effective. The four-year-old company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/meundies">has raised</a> more than $7 million and is growing quickly.</p>
<p>Underwear is a commodity, which is both a challenge and an opportunity for MeUndies. On one hand, this $15 billion market is ripe for disruption, but on the other, they are fighting decades of underwear apathy. Branding and design are fundamental ingredients for their success, which is exactly what these emails set out to achieve.</p>
<h3>Laying the Foundation</h3>
<p>Whether you subscribe or buy, the first email is a message from Jen that sets the tone for your relationship. (The MeUndies team won&rsquo;t reveal Jen&rsquo;s identity and there are billboards begging the question <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/whoisjen/">&ldquo;Who is Jen?&rdquo;</a> around Los Angeles.)</p>

<p>The message is impassioned &ndash; it&rsquo;s essentially a mission statement. MeUndies thinks shopping for underwear is boring and they want to change it. This email lays the foundation for the rest of your MeUndies experience.</p>
<h3>The Welcome Message</h3>
<p>A day later, a more traditional <a href="/resources/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a> arrives. They use the <a href="/resources/1-2-3-method/">1-2-3 method</a> to share three important things that differentiate their company: high-quality materials, great customer service and a 100% satisfaction guarantee. This email is all about alleviating anxiety. The even use <a href="/resources/the-unboxing-technique">the Unboxing Technique</a> to show what a shipment looks like.</p>

<h3>The First Offer</h3>
<p>Just three days later, the first offer arrives. It&rsquo;s <a href="/resources/personalize-your-email">broadly personalized</a> for blog subscribers that haven&rsquo;t made a purchase yet.</p>
<p>This email shines because of its simplicity and clarity. MeUndies uses as few words as possible to provide direction.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7422" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/meundies-email-3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-3.jpg?fit=777%2C478&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="777,478" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="meundies email 3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-3.jpg?fit=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-3.jpg?fit=777%2C478&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7422" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-3.jpg" alt="meundies email 3" width="777" height="478" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-3.jpg?w=777&amp;ssl=1 777w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-3.jpg?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"></p>
<h3>A Different Type of Content Marketing</h3>
<p>To understand the next email, you need to know a little more about the MeUndies business model. You can buy a single pair of underwear, or you can buy a monthly subscription. Each month, they release a new underwear design with an accompanying photo shoot. (These photo shoots have earned them more than 110,000 follows on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meundies/">Instagram</a>.)</p>
<p>This email is content-driven. It announces the design of the month and leverages visual content to get subscribers interested. An email like this arrives each month, creating an expectation of new designs and photos. They also use this content to support their social media strategy in between the monthly email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7423" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/me-undies-email-4/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg?fit=782%2C1923&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="782,1923" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="me undies email 4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg?fit=122%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg?fit=416%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7423" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg" alt="me undies email 4" width="782" height="1923" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg?w=782&amp;ssl=1 782w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg?resize=122%2C300&amp;ssl=1 122w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-4.jpg?resize=416%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 416w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></p>
<h3>The Cross-Sell Email</h3>
<p>Six weeks and five emails later, I still haven&rsquo;t made a purchase. That&rsquo;s when the cross-sell email arrives. It announces that MeUndies sells a collection of sweats that look <em>really</em> comfortable. If the underwear doesn&rsquo;t do it, maybe this will. I like the strategy because they allowed plenty of time before deviating from the core product.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7424" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/me-undies-email-5/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg?fit=776%2C1451&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="776,1451" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="me undies email 5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg?fit=160%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg?fit=548%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7424" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg" alt="me undies email 5" width="776" height="1451" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg?w=776&amp;ssl=1 776w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg?resize=160%2C300&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-undies-email-5.jpg?resize=548%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 548w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px"></p>
<h3>The Black Friday Email</h3>
<p>There are a few reasons I love this email:</p>
<ul><li>The deal is compelling.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s loaded with <a href="/resources/social-proof">social proof</a> in the form of customer testimonials.</li>
<li>It offers a &ldquo;Plan B,&rdquo; i.e. buy them for yourself <em>or</em> give them as a gift.</li>
<li>It uses clear, bold buttons to drive action.</li>
</ul><p>Overall, this is a great email. And it was the last one I received as a non-customer.</p>

<h2>After the Purchase</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed MeUndies&rsquo; emails, but I also heard about them on several podcasts and saw people tweeting about them. They finally convinced me that my underwear was due for an upgrade, so I decided to try it out.</p>
<h3>The Shipping Confirmation Email</h3>
<p><a href="/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/">Shipping confirmation emails</a> don&rsquo;t have to be boring. Derek Sivers <a href="/resources/email-case-studies">famously wrote one</a> that netted him thousands of new customers. MeUndies version is pretty good too. They use the same familiar email template and make the necessary information easily accessible.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7426" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/meundies-email-7/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg?fit=781%2C1032&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="781,1032" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="meundies email 7" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg?fit=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg?fit=775%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7426" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg" alt="meundies email 7" width="781" height="1032" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg?resize=227%2C300&amp;ssl=1 227w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-7.jpg?resize=775%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 775w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px"></p>
<h3>Why Subscribe?</h3>
<p>Past customers are your best leads. If they like your product, it&rsquo;s likely they&rsquo;ll buy again if you give them good reason to. MeUndies&rsquo; product is a good one, so they double down by asking me to subscribe to their monthly package. This is their core business model. In some ways, selling one pair at a time is just a way to get the product in your hands so you can see (and feel) how good it is.</p>
<p>The best part about this email is that it cuts right to the chase by asking the question you&rsquo;re already thinking: &ldquo;Why Subscribe?&rdquo; MeUndies goes on to answer that question, complete with testimonials and a strong call to action.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7427" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/meundies-email-8/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg?fit=781%2C1930&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="781,1930" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="meundies email 8" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg?fit=121%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg?fit=414%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7427" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg" alt="meundies email 8" width="781" height="1930" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg?w=781&amp;ssl=1 781w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg?resize=121%2C300&amp;ssl=1 121w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-8.jpg?resize=414%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 414w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px"></p>
<h3>The Monthly Update</h3>
<p>The best emails are both expected and surprising. The reason <a href="/resources/product-hunt/">Product Hunt&rsquo;s daily email</a> is so good is because you know it&rsquo;s coming, but you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in it. The same is true of MeUndies&rsquo; &ldquo;Design of the Month&rdquo; email.</p>
<p>As always, the design and photography are consistent and engaging. And perhaps more importantly, there is a clear path to the shopping cart.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7428" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/meundies-email-9/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg?fit=782%2C1710&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="782,1710" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="meundies email 9" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg?fit=137%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg?fit=468%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7428" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg" alt="meundies email 9" width="782" height="1710" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg?w=782&amp;ssl=1 782w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg?resize=137%2C300&amp;ssl=1 137w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-9.jpg?resize=468%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 468w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px"></p>
<h3>A Really Good Offer</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t bite on the first subscription offer, so MeUndies asks again. This time, though, they offer 20% off.</p>
<p>There are a few things I really like about this email:</p>
<ul><li>Clearly, MeUndies is segmenting their lists. This email only makes sense to send to past customers who haven&rsquo;t subscribed. That&rsquo;s not rocket science, but I&rsquo;m always amazing how few companies do even simple segmentation like this.</li>
<li>This email is triggered automatically, but includes the most recent underwear design. They are using a dynamic field to ensure the most recent design is featured regardless of when the email is triggered.</li>
<li>Onboarding expert Samuel Hulick&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.useronboard.com/features-vs-benefits/">sums up marketing in one sentence </a>on his blog: &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t buy products; they buy better versions of themselves.&rdquo; MeUndies&rsquo; photography strategy leverages this advice over and over again.</li>
</ul><p><img data-attachment-id="7429" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/before-and-after/meundies-email-10/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg?fit=790%2C1923&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="790,1923" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="meundies email 10" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg?fit=123%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg?fit=421%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7429" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg" alt="meundies email 10" width="790" height="1923" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg?w=790&amp;ssl=1 790w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg?resize=123%2C300&amp;ssl=1 123w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/meundies-email-10.jpg?resize=421%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 421w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px"></p>
<h3>The Small Win Email</h3>
<p>Marketing lead Greg Fass told <a href="http://www.racked.com/2015/11/17/9745864/meundies-underwear-shopping-fun-boxers-thongs">Racked</a> that despite more than 200,000 Facebook fans, MeUndies&rsquo; &ldquo;most active platform is Instagram.&rdquo; To that end, they use email to drive more people to their Instagram page (just like another great business, <a href="/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/#23.">Death to the Stock Photo</a>). The brand is highly social, so while this may seem like a <a href="/resources/small-wins/">small win</a>, it&rsquo;s truly an avenue for sales.</p>
<p>The lesson? Not every email has to seal the deal, but every email should move your customers a step in the right direction.</p>

<html><body><p class="lead">One of the many updates to our <a href="/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">email marketing best practices guide</a> is tip #30: Segment on Signup.</p>
<p>We used Strava as an example. The fitness-tracking tool asks new users if they are runners or cyclists, then tailors onboarding emails to their sport of choice. It&rsquo;s a simple question with a significant impact on the user experience. Cyclists and runners, despite their shared love of pain and suffering, occupy entirely different sub-cultures. It would actually be destructive to send cyclists and runners the same emails when it&rsquo;s so clear they need different messaging.</p>

<p>This got us thinking about other ways to <strong>improve user experience by collecting data before you start sending emails</strong>. We wandered around the Internet in search of great signup flows that also result in great email experiences. We found a few, which you&rsquo;ll find below.</p>
<p>Asking your users to volunteer information can be used in tandem with event tracking. Strava, for example, could infer that I prefer running based on the activities I record, but they don&rsquo;t have that data until later. In the beginning, it&rsquo;s best to ask a few quick questions to get new users up and running (no pun intended) as fast as possible.</p>
<p>This is also really useful for media driven sites like blogs and news publication. Users may never create an account, which would allow you to track events, so simple data collection can be the primary source of segmentation.</p>
<h2>Prove Your Value Before the Signup</h2>
<p><a href="http://poncho.is/" target="_blank">Poncho</a>, a daily weather email, has created an email signup flows. It&rsquo;s so good that it gets new users excited about receiving an email before it&rsquo;s even happened.</p>
<p>They ask questions that spark curiosity, like &ldquo;Wanna know how the day will affect your hair?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do you have pollen allergies?&rdquo; They imply that you&rsquo;ll receive relevant information by answering. And it&rsquo;s no gimmick either. Based on your answers, Poncho will include helpful cues in each email.</p>

<p>For Poncho, <a href="/resources/grammarly" target="_blank">email is the product</a>. They invest in data collection up front to make the user experience as strong as possible. But even if email isn&rsquo;t your core product, it&rsquo;s part of every product. Users associate all interactions &ndash; in-app, notifications, mobile, social, email, etc. &ndash; with your business. Collecting a bit of data can have a compounding effect. The better the initial experience, the more likely it is that a user will stick around.</p>
<h2>Get the Timing Right</h2>
<p>Investing in a better email product isn&rsquo;t hard. We recently wrote about the importance of <a href="/resources/time-zone-management" target="_blank">time zone management</a>. This is a perfect example of a small (and easy to collect) data point that can make a huge difference in the user experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://qz.com/daily-brief" target="_blank">Quartz</a> sends a great daily newsletter containing their top news stories. When new subscribers sign up, Quartz asks for their time zone so they can ensure the email is delivered early in each user&rsquo;s morning. A news-focused email simply isn&rsquo;t as useful in the afternoon.</p>

<p>A sales rep would definitely ask a new customer about their needs and expectations to improve the experience. Do the same with your emails.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about timing, Vero can find a user&rsquo;s location based on their IP address, then allow you to send both newsletters and behavioral campaigns in their time zone.</p>
<h2>Set Clear Expectations</h2>
<p>No one does this better than wedding planners.</p>
<p>They have a hard deadline, so data collection help them set very clear expectations. <a href="https://www.theknot.com/" target="_blank">The Knot</a>, a wedding planning website, uses this same strategy for new users.</p>
<p>These questions don&rsquo;t annoy the user because they set expectations. It&rsquo;s easy to scare off potential signups by badgering them with questions. In order for this strategy to keep a user engaged, the questions must imply that you will use the answers to provide something useful. The Knot does this with friendly copy and obvious questions.</p>

<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t other businesses mirror this strategy?</p>
<p>They can, of course, but most businesses don&rsquo;t deal with hard deadlines like a wedding date. Still, it&rsquo;s not that difficult to set clear expectations, which inevitably leads to a better experience for the user.</p>
<p>The Knot uses this exact strategy for their sister sites, <a href="http://www.thebump.com/" target="_blank">The Bump</a> (for expecting parents) and <a href="http://www.thenest.com/" target="_blank">The Nest</a> (for newlyweds). The Bump, for example, asks new users if they are trying to conceive, currently pregnant or already a parent. Users in each of these roles have entirely different needs. With this data in hand, The Bump can identify their pain points and send useful emails with targeted content.</p>

<p>This strategy ensures that each party is on the same page. For another (very detailed) example, take a look at <a href="/resources/ikea/" target="_blank">how IKEA collects data for deep segmentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Offer Notifications That Are Actually Helpful</h2>
<p>As Alex Potrivaev recently wrote on the <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/its-time-for-notifications-to-get-smart/" target="_blank">Intercom blog</a>, &ldquo;notifications are still stuck in 1999.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because marketers and product managers fire them off for unimportant events. Sure, it&rsquo;s an easy way to drive a little more engagement, but it&rsquo;s also really frustrating to users when you bombard them with useless information.</p>
<p>There is a way to combine better notifications with segmentation. When Garmin announced the release of a new GPS watch a few months ago, they created a product page before it was available. They ask people who view the page to signup for an email alert to be notified about its release.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="600px"><img data-attachment-id="7409" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/collect-the-data/garmin/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/garmin.png?fit=600%2C320&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="garmin" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/garmin.png?fit=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/garmin.png?fit=600%2C320&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7409" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/garmin.png" alt="garmin.png" width="600" height="320" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/garmin.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/garmin.png?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>The result is a helpful notification &ndash; one that seems highly likely to drive a sale &ndash; as well as data for segmentation. Once the email is collected, Garmin can infer quite a bit about the user. They are likely an athlete, they are tech-savvy and they have some disposable income to spend on gadgets. It should help them create strong emails in the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to do this with out-of-stock products, new releases and even private invites to a new app or event. Distilled uses the same strategy for their popular SearchLove conference series. Tickets for the 2017 San Diego event aren&rsquo;t available yet, but you can signup for updates.</p>

<p>This data is so valuable. When the email arrives, it will be expected and anticipated. There&rsquo;s no better sales email than an announcement sent to a waiting list.</p>

<html><body><p class="lead">Automation is changing the way marketers do business. Sadly, it&rsquo;s also affecting customer experiences for the worse.</p>
<p>Autoresponders &ndash; email campaigns that are triggered by a customer event &ndash; are a perfect example. Marketers use them to automate what used to be a manual process. The problem with most autoresponders, however, is that they&rsquo;re sent on a schedule regardless of what the user does in the meantime. It&rsquo;s easy to make the first email in a series great, but after that you&rsquo;re guessing. The content of campaigns doesn&rsquo;t always coincide with what the message the user needs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7362" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Autoresponder@2x.png" alt="Autoresponder@2x.png" width="800" height="435"></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking that autoresponders count as true automation <strong>unless you have a mechanism to stop them</strong>. Marketers tend to load them up with emails and fantasize about their users flowing through a sales funnel.</p>
<p>The truth is that rarely happens. People don&rsquo;t want to receive an 18-step marketing campaign. They might, however, appreciate a few relevant cues. The best email campaigns have filters that prevent certain users from receiving it.</p>
<p>Stopping campaigns is just as important as starting them.</p>
<h2>Where Most Email Campaigns Go Wrong</h2>
<p>Imagine if Twitter sent a welcome campaign without accounting for each new user&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<ul><li>Day 1: Welcome!</li>
<li>Day 2: Here&rsquo;s some popular people to follow</li>
<li>Day 3: Send your first tweet</li>
<li>Day 4: How to use and follow hashtags</li>
</ul><p>If the user signs up, follows a few friends and sends a tweet on day one, the entire campaign is rendered irrelevant. <strong>This creates a bad user experience.</strong></p>
<h2>Stopping Is the New Starting</h2>
<p>Twitter doesn&rsquo;t actually have this problem because they start and stop campaigns based on user behavior. If you upload a profile picture, they&rsquo;ll never ask you to upload a profile picture. They let users lead the way and use emails to guide the user to sustained engagement. The first campaign is a foundation, but there are branches that account for all the different paths a user could take.</p>
<p>The ability to trigger campaigns with events is old news. Stopping campaigns is potentially more useful since it helps you create a better experience for your users. People have enough noise in their inbox, they don&rsquo;t need irrelevant emails asking them to jump through hoops they&rsquo;ve already addressed.</p>
<p>In Vero, we handle this with conditional filters. When you create a campaign, you select a trigger event that kicks it off, then use filters to ensure the wrong people never receive it.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="548px"><img data-attachment-id="7355" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/stop-your-campaigns/vero-campaign-conditions/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?fit=548%2C342&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="548,342" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero campaign conditions" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?fit=548%2C342&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7355" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png" alt="vero campaign conditions" width="548" height="342" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?w=548&amp;ssl=1 548w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>The example above is from our blog welcome campaign. When people subscribe to our blog, we trigger a series of emails with our best articles and a few tips for using Vero. These folks fall into a &lsquo;squeeze&rsquo; situation &ndash; they&rsquo;ve triggered the event <code>Subscribed to blog</code> but not <code>Signed up</code>.</p>
<p>Before each email is sent, Vero checks to make sure each user&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;</p>
<ul><li>Has never received the email before</li>
<li>Has not signed up for a trial</li>
<li>Has not become a paying customer</li>
</ul><p>This means not everyone who starts this campaign sees the end. But that&rsquo;s okay since it means they&rsquo;ve signed up to use Vero. When a new event &ndash; in this case <code>Signed up</code> &ndash; is triggered, a different, more relevant campaign will be launched and this one will go on without them.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s all the ways you can filter users out of a campaign in Vero:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="340px"><img data-attachment-id="7356" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/stop-your-campaigns/all-the-conditions/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?fit=340%2C389&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="340,389" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="all the conditions" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?fit=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?fit=340%2C389&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7356" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png" alt="all the conditions" width="340" height="389" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?w=340&amp;ssl=1 340w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?resize=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1 262w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px"></p>
<p>You can mix and match ANY or ALL conditions, i.e. a user meets a collection of conditions, or they meet one of several conditions. You can use as many of either as you like, allowing you to ensure that users <em>never</em> receive an irrelevant email.</p>
<p>Stopping is the new starting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p class="lead">Data-driven marketing can be sophisticated, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be complex.</p>
<p>Email is a medium that tends to get overcomplicated. It&rsquo;s understandable &ndash; most marketers are managing more than one email tool, dozens of lists of thousands of users. But there is some good news about email personalization &ndash; it&rsquo;s more straightforward than you think. In fact, there are really only three ways to personalize an email. I&rsquo;ll go over each, with a few examples and more detail in this post.</p>
<h2>Personalize with Content</h2>
<p>This is the first and most obvious way to personalize an email. Your goal is to get as close to 1-to-1 messaging as possible. There are a few ways to achieve this.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to gloss over the finer details since <a href="/resources/dynamic-content">we just wrote about this last week</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Basic segmentation</strong></p>
<p>This applies mostly to newsletters. By making it very clear who the email is for, you are essentially segmenting the list. <a href="https://iosdevweekly.com/">iOS Dev Weekly</a> is a good example &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way the wrong people end up on this list, so the content is at least broadly personalized.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Tags</strong></p>
<p>These placeholders are replaced by names, usernames, birthdays and other basic user data at send time.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>Hey {{user.name}}!</code> becomes &ldquo;Hey Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can also use Liquid templates to get more sophisticated. For example, you can use Liquid to pull any user data from Vero into an email.</p>
<p><strong>External Attributes</strong></p>
<p>This is the bread and butter of the world&rsquo;s best email marketers. External attributes is a Vero feature that pulls data from an external API into your emails. If you want to suggest products, send contextual retention emails or capture abandoned carts, this is how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p><a href="/resources/dynamic-content">Read more on content personalization.</a></p>
<h2>Personalize with Timing</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of email, there are two ways to optimize the time an email arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve already segmented by user interest, the next step is identifying the optimal time to send your message. This is done by testing days of the week and time of day. This is common practice but there&rsquo;s a forgotten variable that most marketers overlook: time zones.</p>
<p>Prioritizing your most popular time zone is a mistake. What about the people in other time zones? If a segment responds well to a newsletter at 10am on Tuesday, you can ensure <em>everyone</em> receives it then with our timezone management feature.</p>

<p><a href="/resources/time-zone-management">Read more on time zone management.</a></p>
<p><strong>Lifecycle/Behavioral Emails</strong></p>
<p>Emails that are sent as part of campaign rely on timing as well. While time of the day/week is important, the user&rsquo;s place in the <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a> is more important.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t send an email asking a customer to write a review until they&rsquo;ve had a chance to use your product. Amazon, for example, triggers an event when you finish a Kindle book. They use that to send the email that asks you to review it. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of sending an email at the right moment.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="468px"><img data-attachment-id="7339" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/personalize-your-email/vero-dynamic-segment-example/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?fit=468%2C246&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="468,246" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero dynamic segment example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?fit=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?fit=468%2C246&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7339" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png" alt="vero dynamic segment example" width="468" height="246" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-dynamic-segment-example.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></p>
<p>Event tracking and segmentation is the best way to achieve this. By pushing customer data into Vero, you can ensure users only the receive emails that are contextual and relevant to their</p>

<p>Personalize with Segments<br>
Once you say goodbye to lists, personalization gets so much easier.</p>
<p>Segments are sets of users grouped by condition. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Customers that are tagged with VIP</li>
<li>Customers that haven&rsquo;t tried feature X</li>
<li>Blog subscribers that have read at least two articles</li>
<li>Users who played Level 1 but not Level 2</li>
<li>Customers who signed in with Facebook</li>
</ul><p>The list goes on and on. Here&rsquo;s what the segment builder looks like in Vero:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7346" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/personalize-your-email/vero-segments/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?fit=736%2C309&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="736,309" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="vero segments" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?fit=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?fit=736%2C309&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7346" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg" alt="vero segments" width="736" height="309" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?w=736&amp;ssl=1 736w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-segments.jpg?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s flexible and powerful. Segments are the core of our email tool because it&rsquo;s by far the best way to group users. Plus, they update in real-time. SO if a user no longer meets the conditions, they are removed.</p>

<h3>The Perfect Email</h3>
<p>Once you stop thinking about &ldquo;blasting&rdquo; your users and start thinking about getting as close to 1-to-1 personalization as possible, email becomes much more powerful. The companies that treat email like an extension of their product and not a marketing channel excel at email. And their users reward them for it.</p>

<p>What does surprise me is how often poorly executed campaigns still garner 20 percent open rates. Compare that with an above-average <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-CTR-on-Facebook-ads" target="_blank">Facebook ad</a>, which might have a click-through rate of 0.01%. That&rsquo;s one-tenth of one percent. Truly abysmal.</p>
<p>It might seem like apple to oranges, but most marketers apply the Facebook ad mindset to email. People turn into lists, massive volume becomes a requirement. Marketers default to broadcasts and customers default to apathy. <strong>The moment email becomes a channel, you&rsquo;ve lost the personal touch that makes it so special.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;20% isn&rsquo;t good enough&rdquo; drives much of what we do at Vero. We&rsquo;re out to prove that huge volume and poor conversion rates aren&rsquo;t required to grow your business. Our software is built around people, not lists. It&rsquo;s a scalable CRM, not just a broadcast channel.</p>
<p>The difference is subtle until you dig into the details. Customer-centric software encourages businesses to learn about their users. The data paints a picture of the people behind the pixels. That foundation can support marketing that people actually care about.</p>
<p>Relationships <em>can</em> be built at scale, but not with lists.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p class="lead">Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of prioritizing one time zone over another.</p>
<p>Most marketers approach email timing this way and it&rsquo;s far less than ideal. They test send times, then choose the <em>single time</em> that delivers the most opens and clicks. That only works if you customers are all in the same time zone. Otherwise, there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve said before that <a href="/resources/guides/100-million-emails/">there is no best day to send emails</a>. That&rsquo;s true when you generalize the data, but in your own business, you certainly see lifts at peak times of the day or week.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="600px"><a href="/resources/guides/100-million-emails/"><img data-attachment-id="7291" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/time-zone-management/oimg-1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/oimg-1.png?fit=600%2C371&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="600,371" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="best day to send emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/oimg-1.png?fit=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/oimg-1.png?fit=600%2C371&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7291" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/oimg-1.png" alt="best day to send emails" width="600" height="371" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/oimg-1.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/oimg-1.png?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p>
<p>Finding the best time to send an email <em>seems</em> straightforward enough. Just test a control group against a few variables and follow the clicks, right?</p>
<p>This overlooks the hugely important variable mentioned above: <strong>time zones</strong>.</p>
<p>You might find, for example, that sending a campaign at 10am EST generates the most clicks. But that could mean that some customers are receiving the same email at 4pm or 3am. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;best&rdquo; time relative to the other times you&rsquo;ve tested, but it&rsquo;s not truly optimal. It&rsquo;s a local, not a global, maximum.</p>
<p>In general, emailing a group of people at the exact same time regardless of their location is never going to produce the best results.</p>
<h2>Killin&rsquo; Time</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to handle the tricky challenge of time zone optimization. The rudimentary approach is to prioritize the most common time zone and send to everyone at once.</p>
<p>If you want to go further, you can segment users by time zone and schedule newsletters separately. This works, but it&rsquo;s tedious. You need to find a way to track which timezone customers are in and maintain that data.</p>
<p>That challenge gets stickier if you also trigger behavioral and transactional campaigns as you have to manage two different datasets. You couldn&rsquo;t, for example, create segments based on a user&rsquo;s click or open behavior in a newsletter unless you export the data into Excel and upload new lists and vice versa.There&rsquo;s quite a bit of manual work involved and you&rsquo;re typically left with two datasets and one group of customers. It&rsquo;s less than ideal.</p>
<h2>&ldquo;One Team, One Tool&rdquo;</h2>
<p>One of the product mantras here at Vero is &ldquo;one team, one tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vero is a product that engineers, product teams and marketers use side-by-side to create cohesive email experiences whether you&rsquo;re a team of two or 300. We provide a platform that helps you manage one record per customer, empowering you to ensure every email is consistent and coherent. Our goal is to get your entire team from templates to timing.</p>
<p>Sending in user-specific time zones is a key reason that companies opt for multiple email tools or in-house solutions. And that&rsquo;s the exact point where things get messy.</p>
<p>There are two technical problems teams typically face when building out a solution to target customers in their own time zones:</p>
<ol><li>Customers often end up on multiple lists, meaning the data is not immediately available when sending other campaigns. Perhaps you have the data available on a single list in your email tool, but not in your database for sending triggered emails.</li>
<li>Collecting the data requires geo-tracing IP addresses or using Javascript or similar to determine the location and system timezone of customers on your website. Marrying up this sort of behavioral data with your database data is not something most companies have systems to handle.</li>
</ol><p>We took this on and built a solution that solves time zone challenges for nearly everyone. Vero&rsquo;s API automatically records each users&rsquo; time zone when their data is recorded in Vero. It&rsquo;s one of many layers of context that help you understand your users.</p>
<p>Staying true to our &ldquo;one team, one tool&rdquo; mantra, Vero empowers you to send all of your emails &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re triggered product emails or scheduled marketing newsletters &ndash; based on this customer metadata. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>
<h2>Into the Rabbit Hole</h2>
<p>Adding time zone support to newsletters was the first step at Vero.</p>
<p>Basically, Vero automatically examines the time zone metadata for every user and batches time zones together. All you need to do is tick a box when it comes to schedule your newsletter.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="561px"><img data-attachment-id="7292" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/time-zone-management/vero-time-zone-scheduling/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-time-zone-scheduling.png?fit=561%2C432&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="561,432" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero time zone scheduling" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-time-zone-scheduling.png?fit=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-time-zone-scheduling.png?fit=561%2C432&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7292" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-time-zone-scheduling.png" alt="vero time zone scheduling" width="561" height="432" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-time-zone-scheduling.png?w=561&amp;ssl=1 561w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-time-zone-scheduling.png?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"></p>
<p>Here are a few other ways we make time zone management easy:</p>
<ul><li>We schedule newsletters on the hour, so large batches won&rsquo;t affect each other. A batch is sent every hour until all customers receive your email.</li>
<li>Our API updates your users&rsquo; time zone every time they visit your website, ensuring each send is as accurate as possible.</li>
<li><a href="/resources/recurring-emails">Recurring Newsletters</a> &ndash; newsletters on a repeating schedule &ndash; also support time zone scheduling, so you can send sophisticated reminder emails and reports at a personalized time for every customer.</li>
</ul><h2>Time Zone Management for Behavioral Campaigns</h2>
<p>Time-sensitive campaigns tend to drive revenue, so it&rsquo;s important to understand how and when your emails will be sent.</p>
<p>Say you want to <a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">send a retention email</a> five days after a user last logged into your app. The email would be triggered when you track the event <em>Logs in</em> for a customer.</p>
<p>If you want the email to arrive at 8am five days later you&rsquo;ll need to consider two scenarios to determine the best time to send the email.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Scenario #1</strong></p>
<ul><li>Day 0 (21 October) &ndash; User <em>Logs in</em> at 7:55am in their local timezone.</li>
<li><strong>Day 5</strong> (26 October) &ndash; User receives retention email at 8am.</li>
</ul><p>This is the simplest use case. But if the user&rsquo;s last login was at 8:05am, should the email be sent on the fifth day or the sixth day? It&rsquo;s possible this scenario could play out and you would miss your window to drive engagement or make a sale.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2</strong></p>
<ul><li>Day 0 (21 October) &ndash; User logs in at 8:00am.</li>
<li><strong>Day 6</strong> (27 October) &ndash; User receives retention email at 8:05am</li>
</ul><p>Coding your own logic, it would be easy to calculate at least 120 hours from the trigger activity and then find the next nearest 8am, which would be actually be day six, on the 27 October. This would not be correct, and is what we see here.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how we handle this challenge at Vero. The email <em>should</em> arrive on the fifth day at 8am as you are fulfilling the desire to &ldquo;send an email five days later, at 8am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you schedule an email, Vero calculates two delivery times. The first is the <em>delivery time</em>, and it ensures an email is sent at exactly the desired time delay, i.e. <em>exactly</em> five days after the event was triggered.</p>
<p>The second is the <em>preferred delivery time</em>, which sends the email at a desired time based on the user&rsquo;s time zone unless that time has already passed. In this case, Vero defaults back to the <em>delivery time</em>. We always prioritize the <em>preferred delivery time</em>.</p>
<p>This solves scenario #2, which now looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2, fixed</strong></p>
<ul><li>Day 0 (21 October) &ndash; User logs in at 8:05am.</li>
<li><strong>Day 5</strong> (26 October) &ndash; User receives retention email at 8:00am</li>
</ul><p>The email arrives as expected on the 26 October.</p>

<p>For emails that are highly time-sensitive, you can set time delays in hours or even minutes. That ensures that emails arrive on time. No one wants to receive an email after a promotion is over.</p>

<p>Between our time zone feature and time delay filters, it&rsquo;s possible to send emails in highly specific time windows to people all over the world. That&rsquo;s what we call personalization at scale.</p>
<h2>The Future: Data, Data and More Data</h2>
<p>The question of timing is one that social media marketers have examined thoroughly.</p>
<p>The key difference is that unlike social media, email marketers can&rsquo;t make up for bad timing with volume. Tools like <a href="http://www.tweriod.com/">Tweriod</a> can analyze your followers&rsquo; activity and suggest times to tweet. That gets closer to a true solution, but still means you have to prioritize followers in certain time zones. Wouldn&rsquo;t it better to have your cake and eat it too?</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-research">Buffer found</a> that noon is the most popular time to tweet. Most social media marketers simply prioritize the most popular time zones since it&rsquo;s no problem to schedule multiple tweets per day.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://blog.mailchimp.com/insights-from-mailchimps-send-time-optimization-system/">MailChimp found</a> a similar trend in open rates. Noon is a popular time for email opens, but it&rsquo;s optimal for only seven percent of people. It&rsquo;s better than sending at 5pm, but it&rsquo;s hardly ideal.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a perfect parallel, but social media sites are closer to getting time zones right than email marketers. In the future, it should be possible to analyze your email subscribers individual open and click habits, suggest a time based on their past activity and schedule a newsletter to arrive when they are more likely to open it. Even better, you could schedule recurring emails to arrive at the best time per week and adjust if the trend is moving earlier or later.</p>
<p>The personalization trend has only just begun.</p>

<html><body><p class="lead">Your customers are inundated with hundreds of messages every day. The signal to noise ratio is lower than ever.</p>
<p>But somehow, a handful of businesses manage to stand out in the inbox. Some rely on data to monitor behavior and trigger messages. Others invest in good, old-fashioned branding. Still others make their mark with great copywriting. There is no <em>right</em> way but there are plenty of wrong ones.</p>
<p>Regardless of your approach &ndash; and all three can work in any industry &ndash; there&rsquo;s a fine line between emails that improve your customers&rsquo; experience and emails that hurt it.</p>
<p>Take Zazzle for example. A few months back, <a href="/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/" target="_blank">we wrote about their excellent shipping confirmation email</a>. The experience started off on the right foot but it&rsquo;s since devolved into an endless series of coupons and limited offers. (For the uninitiated, Zazzle is a platform that lets you customize t-shirts, mugs, hats and just about anything else. It&rsquo;s also a platform for makers and artists to sell their products. <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/about" target="_blank">And they use robots for all their product photography.</a>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received 243 emails in the 251 days since my first (and only) purchase.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7070" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="831,244" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7070" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png" alt="zazzle emails" width="831" height="244" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?w=831&amp;ssl=1 831w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px"></p>
<p>I had a great experience on their site but now, I&rsquo;m flooded with offers for everything from throw pillows to smartphone cases. The emails look great and the copy is sharp, but the overall effect is hurtful. Zazzle has commoditized their brand.</p>
<h2>How Zazzle Could Improve Their Email Strategy</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for an outsider to offer blanket advice like &ldquo;send less email.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vero CEO Chris Hexton offered an interesting perspective. &ldquo;If this gets results for Zazzle, should they send fewer emails?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If a key driver of their business model is these daily deals, then perhaps this strategy could be working very well. Maybe it really is the best approach for them. &rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is it <em>has</em> worked well.</p>
<p>Zazzle <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">netted around $250 million</a> in FY2015, a 25 percent increase over 2014. &ldquo;Just because we don&rsquo;t love the business model doesn&rsquo;t mean we can hate on the strategy,&rdquo; Chris reminded me.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">CNBC profile</a> emphasized that Zazzle is &ldquo;doing something crazy by Silicon Valley standards: generating profit.&rdquo; No e-commerce company &ndash; except, perhaps, Amazon &ndash; can afford to forgo profits while they build a platform, audience or brand. Whatever Zazzle is doing clearly works.</p>
<p>That said, daily &ldquo;spray and pray&rdquo; emails aren&rsquo;t always the best way to appeal to customers. We like Zazzle and we&rsquo;re fans of businesses actually pursuing revenue. So we pose this question: <strong>How can Zazzle send fewer emails and make more money?</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>
<h3>Ask for more customer information and use it.</h3>
<p>I went digging around my Zazzle account and found that you can complete a profile. This information is the key to better marketing. But I&rsquo;ve never been asked to fill it out.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="276px"><img data-attachment-id="7091" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-profile/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="276,291" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle profile" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7091" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png" alt="zazzle profile" width="276" height="291"></p>
<p>I made my first purchase on Zazzle because I wanted a custom t-shirt. They delivered and I was a happy customer. But a few days after the order shipped, the onslaught of emails began. I immediately (and subconsciously) started ignoring their marketing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smart to capitalize on the momentum of a first purchase. Instead of telling new customers about the next sale, what if Zazzle offered $5 off the next purchase in exchange for a completed profile? That would give them access to gender, location, age, social profiles and more.</p>
<p>Data like this unlocks an opportunity for better email.</p>

<p>Lots of SaaS companies, like Twitter, use sign-up momentum to collect basic demographic data. E-commerce businesses like Zazzle can borrow inspiration from their SaaS peers.</p>

<p>Zazzle could personalize emails based on user attributes. Customers in Boston would appreciate <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/wicked_smart_smaht_college_boston_shirt-235654743384871778">this shirt</a>.</p>

<p>Pinterest users might be interested in their <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">Pinterest boards</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t one-to-one email marketing but it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. Personalized offers are more compelling than exclusive discounts and weekend sales. The more Zazzle gets to know their customers, the more focused their marketing can be.</p>
<p>Imagine how nice it would be to surprise customers with relevant emails instead of hammering them with offers.</p>
<h3>Automate follow-up emails based on behavior.</h3>
<p><a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">Inactivity and retention emails</a> are the bread and butter of most SaaS email campaigns. Without recurring subscription revenue, e-commerce businesses need to spend even more time thinking about customer retention.</p>
<p>There are <a href="/resources/triggered-retention-emails/">three different types of inactivity</a>: initial, partial and complete. The relationship begins with an event like a purchase or email signup and customers should receive different types of emails based on how long they&rsquo;ve been inactive.</p>
<p>In each case, behavioral emails work well because campaigns can start or stop depending the customers&rsquo; activity (or lack thereof). Here are examples of each.</p>
<p><strong>Initial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>A customer makes a purchase but doesn&rsquo;t view any additional products within two weeks. Go for the small win by asking them to follow you on Pinterest, write a product review, check out related products or see curated products on a blog.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7168" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/airbnb-curated-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="693,855" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="airbnb curated email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7168" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg" alt="airbnb curated email" width="693" height="855" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?w=693&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"></p>
<p>Airbnb is a good example. They curate popular listings for inactive customers.</p>
<p>If customers show interest in a listing, <a href="/resources/the-retention-email/">Airbnb sends specific follow-up emails</a>. Everything here is automated. The curated emails generate activity, which can be used to send more targeted messages.</p>
<p><strong>Partial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>As time passes without a repeat purchase, emails tend include more urgency and deeper discounts. That&rsquo;s one way to do it. But with more data, it&rsquo;s easy to send targeted emails.</p>

<p>Take ProFlowers for example. Knowing that most customers are buying gifts, they send these helpful reminders. I hadn&rsquo;t used ProFlowers in a year but upon receipt of this email, made another purchase. This is called a <a href="/resources/replenishment-email/">replenishment email</a> and it&rsquo;s one of the most under-utilized forms of e-commerce marketing.</p>
<p>Product updates are another way to engage partially inactive customers. If something new or exciting has happened since the customer last visited your site, let them know via email.</p>

<p>As the months go on, it&rsquo;s time to make one last offer and say goodbye.</p>

<p>You can try a &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; email to make a really compelling offer.</p>
<p>Remember though &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve toned down the frequency of your marketing emails, &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; emails stand out. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re just another email that gets lost in the mix.</p>
<h3>Use content, not products, to drive engagement.</h3>
<p>Evernote has a problem. Their software is a blank slate. It can be used for so many things but every new customer starts at the same place: square one.</p>
<p>Zazzle has a similar problem. Because customers can customize products, the possibilities are endless. This is where content can provide inspiration. Evernote uses case studies and product updates to show users how to use their software. Zazzle does a bit of this <a href="http://blog.zazzle.com/2015/10/06/3-killer-halloween-party-themes-decor-ideas/">on their blog</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">on Pinterest</a> but it&rsquo;s hidden in the footers of their emails.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/email-footer-zazzle/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?fit=658%2C207&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="658,207" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email footer zazzle" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?fit=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?fit=658%2C207&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7204" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png" alt="email footer zazzle" width="658" height="207" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></p>
<p>Their goal is move products, not drive pageviews. But it&rsquo;s hard to sell to the same customers every day. Content could dive into seasonal events, showcase what other customers are doing and provide visual inspiration for home decor and gifts.</p>

<p>Evernote leads with content but shows how their product can help users achieve their goals.</p>

<p>Spartan provides daily workouts in their newsletter. Instead of selling the adventure races all the time, they encourage fitness, then drive engaged users to races and other events.</p>
<p>Mixing content into Zazzle&rsquo;s email flow would break up the monotony of the sales-heavy emails and engage customers in a new way. Content also supports social media engagement and discovery. For e-commerce companies, it&rsquo;s part of a balanced marketing strategy.</p>
