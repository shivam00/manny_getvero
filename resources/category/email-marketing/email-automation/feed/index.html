<html><body><p class="lead">Automation is changing the way marketers do business. Sadly, it&rsquo;s also affecting customer experiences for the worse.</p>
<p>Autoresponders &ndash; email campaigns that are triggered by a customer event &ndash; are a perfect example. Marketers use them to automate what used to be a manual process. The problem with most autoresponders, however, is that they&rsquo;re sent on a schedule regardless of what the user does in the meantime. It&rsquo;s easy to make the first email in a series great, but after that you&rsquo;re guessing. The content of campaigns doesn&rsquo;t always coincide with what the message the user needs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7362" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Autoresponder@2x.png" alt="Autoresponder@2x.png" width="800" height="435"></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking that autoresponders count as true automation <strong>unless you have a mechanism to stop them</strong>. Marketers tend to load them up with emails and fantasize about their users flowing through a sales funnel.</p>
<p>The truth is that rarely happens. People don&rsquo;t want to receive an 18-step marketing campaign. They might, however, appreciate a few relevant cues. The best email campaigns have filters that prevent certain users from receiving it.</p>
<p>Stopping campaigns is just as important as starting them.</p>
<h2>Where Most Email Campaigns Go Wrong</h2>
<p>Imagine if Twitter sent a welcome campaign without accounting for each new user&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<ul><li>Day 1: Welcome!</li>
<li>Day 2: Here&rsquo;s some popular people to follow</li>
<li>Day 3: Send your first tweet</li>
<li>Day 4: How to use and follow hashtags</li>
</ul><p>If the user signs up, follows a few friends and sends a tweet on day one, the entire campaign is rendered irrelevant. <strong>This creates a bad user experience.</strong></p>
<h2>Stopping Is the New Starting</h2>
<p>Twitter doesn&rsquo;t actually have this problem because they start and stop campaigns based on user behavior. If you upload a profile picture, they&rsquo;ll never ask you to upload a profile picture. They let users lead the way and use emails to guide the user to sustained engagement. The first campaign is a foundation, but there are branches that account for all the different paths a user could take.</p>
<p>The ability to trigger campaigns with events is old news. Stopping campaigns is potentially more useful since it helps you create a better experience for your users. People have enough noise in their inbox, they don&rsquo;t need irrelevant emails asking them to jump through hoops they&rsquo;ve already addressed.</p>
<p>In Vero, we handle this with conditional filters. When you create a campaign, you select a trigger event that kicks it off, then use filters to ensure the wrong people never receive it.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="548px"><img data-attachment-id="7355" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/stop-your-campaigns/vero-campaign-conditions/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?fit=548%2C342&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="548,342" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero campaign conditions" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?fit=548%2C342&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7355" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png" alt="vero campaign conditions" width="548" height="342" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?w=548&amp;ssl=1 548w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/vero-campaign-conditions.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>The example above is from our blog welcome campaign. When people subscribe to our blog, we trigger a series of emails with our best articles and a few tips for using Vero. These folks fall into a &lsquo;squeeze&rsquo; situation &ndash; they&rsquo;ve triggered the event <code>Subscribed to blog</code> but not <code>Signed up</code>.</p>
<p>Before each email is sent, Vero checks to make sure each user&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;</p>
<ul><li>Has never received the email before</li>
<li>Has not signed up for a trial</li>
<li>Has not become a paying customer</li>
</ul><p>This means not everyone who starts this campaign sees the end. But that&rsquo;s okay since it means they&rsquo;ve signed up to use Vero. When a new event &ndash; in this case <code>Signed up</code> &ndash; is triggered, a different, more relevant campaign will be launched and this one will go on without them.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s all the ways you can filter users out of a campaign in Vero:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="340px"><img data-attachment-id="7356" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/stop-your-campaigns/all-the-conditions/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?fit=340%2C389&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="340,389" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="all the conditions" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?fit=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?fit=340%2C389&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7356" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png" alt="all the conditions" width="340" height="389" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?w=340&amp;ssl=1 340w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/all-the-conditions.png?resize=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1 262w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px"></p>
<p>You can mix and match ANY or ALL conditions, i.e. a user meets a collection of conditions, or they meet one of several conditions. You can use as many of either as you like, allowing you to ensure that users <em>never</em> receive an irrelevant email.</p>
<p>Stopping is the new starting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p class="lead">Your customers are inundated with hundreds of messages every day. The signal to noise ratio is lower than ever.</p>
<p>But somehow, a handful of businesses manage to stand out in the inbox. Some rely on data to monitor behavior and trigger messages. Others invest in good, old-fashioned branding. Still others make their mark with great copywriting. There is no <em>right</em> way but there are plenty of wrong ones.</p>
<p>Regardless of your approach &ndash; and all three can work in any industry &ndash; there&rsquo;s a fine line between emails that improve your customers&rsquo; experience and emails that hurt it.</p>
<p>Take Zazzle for example. A few months back, <a href="/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/" target="_blank">we wrote about their excellent shipping confirmation email</a>. The experience started off on the right foot but it&rsquo;s since devolved into an endless series of coupons and limited offers. (For the uninitiated, Zazzle is a platform that lets you customize t-shirts, mugs, hats and just about anything else. It&rsquo;s also a platform for makers and artists to sell their products. <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/about" target="_blank">And they use robots for all their product photography.</a>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received 243 emails in the 251 days since my first (and only) purchase.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7070" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="831,244" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7070" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png" alt="zazzle emails" width="831" height="244" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?w=831&amp;ssl=1 831w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px"></p>
<p>I had a great experience on their site but now, I&rsquo;m flooded with offers for everything from throw pillows to smartphone cases. The emails look great and the copy is sharp, but the overall effect is hurtful. Zazzle has commoditized their brand.</p>
<h2>How Zazzle Could Improve Their Email Strategy</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for an outsider to offer blanket advice like &ldquo;send less email.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vero CEO Chris Hexton offered an interesting perspective. &ldquo;If this gets results for Zazzle, should they send fewer emails?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If a key driver of their business model is these daily deals, then perhaps this strategy could be working very well. Maybe it really is the best approach for them. &rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is it <em>has</em> worked well.</p>
<p>Zazzle <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">netted around $250 million</a> in FY2015, a 25 percent increase over 2014. &ldquo;Just because we don&rsquo;t love the business model doesn&rsquo;t mean we can hate on the strategy,&rdquo; Chris reminded me.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">CNBC profile</a> emphasized that Zazzle is &ldquo;doing something crazy by Silicon Valley standards: generating profit.&rdquo; No e-commerce company &ndash; except, perhaps, Amazon &ndash; can afford to forgo profits while they build a platform, audience or brand. Whatever Zazzle is doing clearly works.</p>
<p>That said, daily &ldquo;spray and pray&rdquo; emails aren&rsquo;t always the best way to appeal to customers. We like Zazzle and we&rsquo;re fans of businesses actually pursuing revenue. So we pose this question: <strong>How can Zazzle send fewer emails and make more money?</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>
<h3>Ask for more customer information and use it.</h3>
<p>I went digging around my Zazzle account and found that you can complete a profile. This information is the key to better marketing. But I&rsquo;ve never been asked to fill it out.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="276px"><img data-attachment-id="7091" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-profile/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="276,291" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle profile" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7091" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png" alt="zazzle profile" width="276" height="291"></p>
<p>I made my first purchase on Zazzle because I wanted a custom t-shirt. They delivered and I was a happy customer. But a few days after the order shipped, the onslaught of emails began. I immediately (and subconsciously) started ignoring their marketing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smart to capitalize on the momentum of a first purchase. Instead of telling new customers about the next sale, what if Zazzle offered $5 off the next purchase in exchange for a completed profile? That would give them access to gender, location, age, social profiles and more.</p>
<p>Data like this unlocks an opportunity for better email.</p>

<p>Lots of SaaS companies, like Twitter, use sign-up momentum to collect basic demographic data. E-commerce businesses like Zazzle can borrow inspiration from their SaaS peers.</p>

<p>Pinterest users might be interested in their <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">Pinterest boards</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t one-to-one email marketing but it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. Personalized offers are more compelling than exclusive discounts and weekend sales. The more Zazzle gets to know their customers, the more focused their marketing can be.</p>
<p>Imagine how nice it would be to surprise customers with relevant emails instead of hammering them with offers.</p>
<h3>Automate follow-up emails based on behavior.</h3>
<p><a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">Inactivity and retention emails</a> are the bread and butter of most SaaS email campaigns. Without recurring subscription revenue, e-commerce businesses need to spend even more time thinking about customer retention.</p>
<p>There are <a href="/resources/triggered-retention-emails/">three different types of inactivity</a>: initial, partial and complete. The relationship begins with an event like a purchase or email signup and customers should receive different types of emails based on how long they&rsquo;ve been inactive.</p>
<p>In each case, behavioral emails work well because campaigns can start or stop depending the customers&rsquo; activity (or lack thereof). Here are examples of each.</p>
<p><strong>Initial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>A customer makes a purchase but doesn&rsquo;t view any additional products within two weeks. Go for the small win by asking them to follow you on Pinterest, write a product review, check out related products or see curated products on a blog.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7168" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/airbnb-curated-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="693,855" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="airbnb curated email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7168" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg" alt="airbnb curated email" width="693" height="855" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?w=693&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"></p>
<p>Airbnb is a good example. They curate popular listings for inactive customers.</p>
<p>If customers show interest in a listing, <a href="/resources/the-retention-email/">Airbnb sends specific follow-up emails</a>. Everything here is automated. The curated emails generate activity, which can be used to send more targeted messages.</p>
<p><strong>Partial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>As time passes without a repeat purchase, emails tend include more urgency and deeper discounts. That&rsquo;s one way to do it. But with more data, it&rsquo;s easy to send targeted emails.</p>

<p>Take ProFlowers for example. Knowing that most customers are buying gifts, they send these helpful reminders. I hadn&rsquo;t used ProFlowers in a year but upon receipt of this email, made another purchase. This is called a <a href="/resources/replenishment-email/">replenishment email</a> and it&rsquo;s one of the most under-utilized forms of e-commerce marketing.</p>
<p>Product updates are another way to engage partially inactive customers. If something new or exciting has happened since the customer last visited your site, let them know via email.</p>

<p>You can try a &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; email to make a really compelling offer.</p>
<p>Remember though &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve toned down the frequency of your marketing emails, &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; emails stand out. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re just another email that gets lost in the mix.</p>
<h3>Use content, not products, to drive engagement.</h3>
<p>Evernote has a problem. Their software is a blank slate. It can be used for so many things but every new customer starts at the same place: square one.</p>
<p>Zazzle has a similar problem. Because customers can customize products, the possibilities are endless. This is where content can provide inspiration. Evernote uses case studies and product updates to show users how to use their software. Zazzle does a bit of this <a href="http://blog.zazzle.com/2015/10/06/3-killer-halloween-party-themes-decor-ideas/">on their blog</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">on Pinterest</a> but it&rsquo;s hidden in the footers of their emails.</p>

<p>Spartan provides daily workouts in their newsletter. Instead of selling the adventure races all the time, they encourage fitness, then drive engaged users to races and other events.</p>
<p>Mixing content into Zazzle&rsquo;s email flow would break up the monotony of the sales-heavy emails and engage customers in a new way. Content also supports social media engagement and discovery. For e-commerce companies, it&rsquo;s part of a balanced marketing strategy.</p>

<html><body><p>Segmentation in email marketing leads to higher open and click rates, fewer unsubscribes and, in general, a better experience for your customers. But most marketers don&rsquo;t invest enough time in segmentation, and a result, don&rsquo;t reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Additionally, segmentation is most useful when marketing collaborates with customer support, sales and accounting. I know &ndash; it&rsquo;s already starting to feel overwhelming which is where most people quit. Rest assured that segmentation is easier than you think and, for most, <strong>the biggest challenge to email segmentation is the right toolkit.</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a perfect example:</p>
<p>A few years ago, I worked on a segmentation campaign for a small e-commerce store. We exported data from our email provider and our shopping cart provider, then used Excel to combine the lists, match the emails, tag the customers in a number of different categories and then upload new CSVs back into the email provider to create lists. And we had to do this every week to make sure the lists were up-to-date for new email campaigns.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder than most marketers don&rsquo;t spend much time on segmentation. What a pain!</p>
<p>Luckily, SaaS tools have come a long way since then and it&rsquo;s much easier to segment customers. At Vero, we&rsquo;ve done away with the concept of lists altogether and use segments as the primary way to group customers. All the data collection, tagging and segmentation happens automatically in the app.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the ways that segments are better than lists:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Segments are real-time.</strong> For example, a segment of people who viewed the pricing page twice in the last 30 days will change as different customers pass through that 30-day window. It&rsquo;s also possible to create &lsquo;static&rsquo; segments by tagging people. (Example: Manually apply a tag to your 100 best customers.)</li>
<li><strong>Segments are limitless.</strong> You can use as many conditions as you want to create segments. This includes events, opens/clicks on email campaigns, tags and user attributes (like name, location, gender, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Segments are cross-platform.</strong>  Events can be tracked across multiple mediums &ndash; apps, e-commerce store, website, blog, etc. &ndash; so segments can be created using data from all sources. For example, you can create a segment of people that opened an email campaign and created an account but never finished their profile.</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since we&rsquo;ve used Excel to segment a list and we aren&rsquo;t looking back. The best part is that is it&rsquo;s easier than ever to send emails to the right people. This makes for a dramatically better customer experience, and much less hassle for the marketing team.</p>
<p>Here are just a few ways we use segmentation in our email marketing.</p>
<h3 class="with-line">Create Targeted Onboarding Campaigns</h3>
<p>We track a lot of data about our free trial users and we use segments to keep see where new customers are in the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a>. For example, we track an event when new users save their first campaign and another when they send it. We have a segment that keeps track of people in between these two events so we can reach out with help.</p>
<p>Take a look at the rules here &ndash; it&rsquo;s grouping people who have saved a campaign but not yet sent it. We know that users who actually send campaigns are much more likely to become paying customers so we automate an email to these people and see what help they need to continue.</p>
<p>This is a good example of a dynamic campaign since the number of people in it changes based on users&rsquo; behavior.</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Measure the Success of a Campaign</h3>
<p>We use content upgrades on the blog to grow our email list. Posts with a content upgrade contain a form that triggers a unique event, such as <em><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">Requests TripAdvisor Swipe File</a></em>. (This is very easy to do with Vero&rsquo;s form builder.)</p>
<p>We then create a segment to keep track of all the people who have triggered the event &hellip;</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Monitor Inactivity</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to reduce churn is identifying customers who aren&rsquo;t getting value for their money. A good place to start is by looking at paying customers who haven&rsquo;t logged in. Once you can create this segment, you can dig into <em>why</em> they aren&rsquo;t getting value and solve the issue before they leave.</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Identify Leads for Outbound Sales</h3>
<p>Segments are a great way to identify prospects who are showing interest in your product or service. <strong>We use data to measure intent.</strong> For example, each time we send an email newsletter, we create a segment that tracks prospects who opened the newsletter <em>and</em> have looked at our homepage in the last 30 days.</p>

<h3 class="with-line">Keep Track of Your Best Customers</h3>
<p>Automation is great but sometimes you need the ability to segment manually. We&rsquo;ve manually tagged our best customers with the tag &ldquo;VIP&rdquo;. This makes it easy to offers perks like beta access to new features.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. Dynamic segments give you an almost unlimited ability to dissect your database and learn about your customers. Here are a few more tips for getting the most out of Vero&rsquo;s segmentation tools.</p>
<h2>Using Vero&rsquo;s Segment Feature</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, one of biggest barriers to segmentation is the tools. Vero solves that problem. Here are a few tips to help you get the most value from our Segment feature.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Nesting:</strong> You can create segments of segments. This is useful for combining two related segments or refining an existing segment without overwriting the original.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax:</strong> We recommend using some type of syntax to organization your segments.  We use [Customers] for existing customers, [Activation] for free trial users and [Blog] for content marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Cloning:</strong> If you want to create several campaigns with minor differences, just create one, then clone it.
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://ucarecdn.com/e2b7f8a9-df35-4f4d-975a-8d67ba81c960/" alt="Screenshot 2015-06-11 15.49.44.png"></p>
<p>For example, you might create segments for customers with varying levels of activity. Set it up once then just change the one condition that makes the segment unique.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Sending campaigns:</strong> When it comes time queue up a newsletter or behavioral campaign, you can target one or more segments. Building segments into the campaigns is a constant reminder that you should be sending targeted emails.</li>
</ul><p>We encourage you to signup for a free trial and create a few segments of your own. Have any questions about segmentation? You can email us at <a href="support@getvero.com">support@getvero.com</a> or leave a note in the comments.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>If you sell a subscription online or run a SaaS business, then you will regularly be asking customers to upgrade and, odds on, you&rsquo;ll be doing so via email.</p>
<p>There are a <strong>lot</strong> of things you need to get right before a customer is ready to upgrade and start a subscription but, assuming that you <strong>have</strong> moved your customers through your funnel successfully, <strong>how should you write your upgrade email</strong>?</p>
<p>I am going to share a <strong>great</strong> example I received recently and, with a little deconstruction, we can determine why this email works so well and what lessons we you can apply to your own upgrade emails.</p>
<h2>Show me the copy!</h2>
<p>To get the ball rolling, here&rsquo;s a copy of the upgrade email I received from Emil at <a href="http://helpjuice.com" target="_blank">Helpjuice</a>, <strong>marked up with everything I think it gets right</strong>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4286" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/secret-to-upgrade-emails/upgrade-email-example/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?fit=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,900" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="upgrade-email-example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4286" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png" alt="upgrade-email-example" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2>What works here</h2>
<p>I recently mentioned another of Emil&rsquo;s emails my post sharing <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/03/20/examples-retention-emails/">five killer examples of email remarketing</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say I&rsquo;ve become a big fan of Helpjuice&rsquo;s approach to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-guide/campaign-strategy/" target="_blank">lifecycle marketing</a> throughout my free trial but my favourite three things about <strong>this</strong> particular email are:</p>
<ol><li>Emil gives the recipient a <strong>choice</strong>. If you&rsquo;re <strong>not</strong> ready to upgrade then he recommends giving him a call. This is <strong>much warmer</strong> than the usual copy that goes along the lines of &ldquo;Upgrade your account today or we&rsquo;ll delete it!&rdquo;</li>
<li>He provides a good case for <strong>choosing a higher plan</strong> ($99/month) by linking to a very informative article on the <strong>positives of doing so</strong>. He also gets to show off his own product in this way (as that&rsquo;s where the article is hosted).</li>
<li>Emil uses a <strong>personal tone</strong> and includes a <strong>photo of himself</strong>. This approach goes a long way and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/5-conversion-optimization-experts-email-remarketing-campaign-hipchat/">being personal helps build trust</a> as you share your story and your persona with your customers.</li>
</ol><p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about this email but what else can you do to make it even <strong>more effective</strong>?</p>
<h2>How YOU can go one better</h2>
<p>In taking inspiration from Emil&rsquo;s email and giving your upgrade email a facelift, here are a few other ideas that will make this email even more effective:</p>
<ol><li>Include the primary Call To Action (CTA) again at <strong>the bottom of the email</strong>.</li>
<li>Use<strong> social proof</strong>. Write a postscript featuring a positive quote from a customer.</li>
<li>Link <strong>directly to the actual upgrade screen</strong> rather than explain how to get there.</li>
<li>Make the <strong>links clickable</strong>, e.g. &lsquo;To upgrade, simply <strong>visit your control panel</strong> and choose a plan&hellip;&rsquo; as opposed to plaintext.</li>
<li>Have a<strong> benefit-based subject line</strong> such as &ldquo;Keep shaving time off your customer support efforts&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;Your Free Trial Has Nearly Expired&rdquo; or similar.</li>
<li>Try using the term &lsquo;Go pro&rsquo; or <strong>something NON-developer-centric</strong> instead of &lsquo;Upgrade&rsquo; &ndash; thanks Brian Massey for this tip when he and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/5-conversion-optimization-experts-email-remarketing-campaign-hipchat/">four other conversion optimization experts reviewed HipChat&rsquo;s SaaS welcome email</a>).</li>
</ol><h2>Get those upgrades!</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! A short and sweet example of a really effective upgrade email. Definitely jump into your own lifecycle email sequence and incorporate the tips above to <strong>give your upgrade email a little extra power</strong>. After all, this is a fantastic example of the sort of lifecycle email you should be sending your customers.</p>
<p>What do you think &ndash; what extra elements or ideas would you test to improve on Emil&rsquo;s email?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p><em>Vero&rsquo;s world-first <strong>external attributes</strong> feature allows you to use <strong>more data</strong> to personalise your emails on a truly one-to-one basis.</em></p>
<hr><p>I recently heard someone say &ldquo;before long, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/future-of-email-marketing/">A/B testing will be dead</a>&ldquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a little alarmist, but their point was that we live in a world where people want more, customised and faster than ever before.</p>
<p>When it comes to email marketing, the focus is shifting to campaigns personalised at a one-to-one level.</p>
<p><span id="more-3852"></span></p>
<p>Amazon does stuff like this all the time:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3859" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/external-attributes/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?fit=829%2C467&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="829,467" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?fit=829%2C467&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3859" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png" alt="amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign" width="829" height="467" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?w=829&amp;ssl=1 829w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?resize=178%2C100&amp;ssl=1 178w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-lifecycle-email-campaign.png?resize=75%2C42&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 829px) 100vw, 829px"></p>
<p>To insert those camera images, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/6-lessons-you-can-learn-from-amazons-killer-email-marketing/">Amazon</a> has to know three things:</p>
<ol><li>Who you are.</li>
<li>What you&rsquo;ve looked at on their site.</li>
<li>What products <strong>are related</strong>.</li>
</ol><p>If you haven&rsquo;t checked out Vero&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/behavioral-email-ideas/">event-based email automation</a>, <strong>you should</strong>. For a long time now, Vero has helped customers with one and two: our API allows you to track <em>who is one your site</em> and <em>what they are doing</em>.</p>
<div style="margin: 20px 0;
display: block;
color: #00c3e4;
display: block;
text-transform: uppercase;
font-style: italic;

<p>Without question, one-to-one personalization is the future of email marketing.</p>
</div>
<p>This might be looking at a features page, viewing a product, upgrading to one of your subscriptions, testing a new feature, and so on.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s difficult for Vero to capture the sort of data needed to do number three.</p>
<p>So, instead, we built a world first: a tool that gives you the ability to <strong>insert your own data in each individual email before it goes out</strong>.</p>
<h2>Increasing conversions one customer at a time</h2>
<p>Simon and the team over at <a href="http://www.zodee.com.au" target="_blank">Zodee</a> sell ladies undergarments and swimwear.</p>
<p>They already had some great campaigns but wanted to make them even more personal, so they turned to Vero&rsquo;s <strong>external attributes</strong> feature.</p>
<p>This allows them to call their own web server before each newsletter goes out and return custom items.</p>
<p>Take the following newsletter:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3860" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/external-attributes/zodee-replaced/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?fit=711%2C1330&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="711,1330" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="personalized-email-example-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?fit=160%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?fit=547%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3860" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg" alt="personalized-email-example-1" width="711" height="1330" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?w=711&amp;ssl=1 711w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?resize=160%2C300&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?resize=547%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 547w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?resize=53%2C100&amp;ssl=1 53w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?resize=27%2C50&amp;ssl=1 27w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-replaced.jpg?resize=40%2C75&amp;ssl=1 40w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px"></p>
<p>See those eight swimsuits at the bottom?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re customised on a user-by-user basis. For each of Zodee&rsquo;s customers this email looks different. Killer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what that same newsletter looks like in the Vero editor:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3861" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/external-attributes/zodee-marked-up/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?fit=800%2C509&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,509" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="personalized-email-example-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?fit=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?fit=800%2C509&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3861" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png" alt="personalized-email-example-2" width="800" height="509" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?resize=157%2C100&amp;ssl=1 157w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?resize=50%2C32&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/zodee-marked-up.png?resize=75%2C48&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>After you take a closer look, you can see that this is in fact our custom external attributes filter at work. You can <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/knowledge-base/writing-and-configuring-emails/fetch-external-remote-data-before-sending-email/">read more on the details</a> of how it works, but at a high level, this filter allows you to specify a place on your website that will return custom HTML to be inserted in the email before it goes out.</p>
<p>This code gets executed before each and every email goes out, so you can include custom attributes for each user if you want &ndash; meaning every email looks different.</p>
<p>(If you&rsquo;re worried about scale, we&rsquo;ll cache queries wherever we can, so this can work with thousands <em>or</em> tens of millions of subscribers).</p>
<p>In the example above Simon is calling a product recommendation endpoint and passing along the individual recipient&rsquo;s country, influencing which products are returned.</p>
<p>This is insane and takes each and every outbound email to a whole new level. We&rsquo;re big fans of what the Zodee team have achieved with this tool and think they&rsquo;re a shining example for others.</p>
<h2>Unlocking Raw Power</h2>
<p>The external attributes power lets you customise your emails in a way you haven&rsquo;t been able to before. It gives your marketers the ability to alter emails and yet doesn&rsquo;t require any compromise on what you can achieve.</p>
<p>In the case of Zodee, these emails couldn&rsquo;t have been built without this feature: as the data simply wasn&rsquo;t available to use. Now they can use as much data as they want.</p>
<p>There are two key ways you can include external data:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Via HTML</strong>. This is similar to Simon&rsquo;s email above where you return raw HTML to include in your outgoing email.</li>
<li><strong>Using JSON.</strong> This allows you to call an API of your own and access JSON hash data before processing your outgoing emails.</li>
</ol><p>A simple example of our own: we recently built an API endpoint that allows us to return custom coupon codes on the fly.</p>
<p>Using this endpoint, we are now able to create emails like this one:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3862" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/external-attributes/vero-individual-coupon/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?fit=800%2C328&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,328" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero-individual-coupon" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?fit=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?fit=800%2C328&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3862" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png" alt="vero-individual-coupon" width="800" height="328" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?resize=300%2C123&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?resize=244%2C100&amp;ssl=1 244w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?resize=50%2C21&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vero-individual-coupon.png?resize=75%2C31&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>In this instance we return a simple coupon code, e.g. &ldquo;XKL18LmA&rdquo;, that our customers can use.</p>
<p>Including this sort of data in an email based on information captured by our event tracking was difficult: it would be hard to retrospectively create coupons and we would potentially be creating a lot of wasted coupons.</p>
<p>Instead, the external attributes feature gives us the power we need.</p>
<h2>Over To You</h2>
<p>What great ideas can you come up with to use our external attributes feature that give your emails more personality and more personalisation? We&rsquo;d love to hear about them in the comments or via <a href="mailto:support@getvero.com">support@getvero.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to use external attributes you can unlock the feature on our $299/month and above plans, or give us an email and have a chat (<a href="mailto:support@getvero.com">support@getvero.com</a>). You can <a href="http://app.getvero.com/account/subscriptions">upgrade at any time</a> and downgrade later too, if you just want to try it out.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to see what you come up with!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>You know that moment when you come across something so interesting, so thought-provoking that you just have to share it?</p>
<p>This is that moment.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Rand Fishkin published a video called <a href="http://moz.com/blog/the-greatest-misconception-in-content-marketing-whiteboard-friday">The Greatest Misconception in Content Marketing</a>. Like most of his videos, Rand used plain and simple terms to explain why a lot of content marketing fails. More recently, he followed up on it with an 86-slide deck that further explains why content marketing fails.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s simple, really. The stakeholders funding the content marketing don&rsquo;t understand how it works and expect unreasonably fast or massive results without enough budget, resources and time. Blogging doesn&rsquo;t create business, at least not right away.</p>
<p><span id="more-2860"></span></p>
<p>Rand broke it down into five mistakes that marketers make that result in failure:</p>
<ol><li>You believed the biggest myth content marketing ever told the world. (Gotta see the slides for this one.)</li>
<li>You made content without a community.</li>
<li>You invested in content creation, but not in it&rsquo;s amplification.</li>
<li>You ignored content marketing&rsquo;s most powerful channel: SEO</li>
<li>You gave up way too soon.</li>
</ol><p>This deck &ndash; all 86 slides &ndash; is pure gold for content marketers.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="597" height="486" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/34772391?rel=0" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="Why Content Marketing Fails" href="https://www.slideshare.net/randfish/why-content-marketing-fails" target="_blank">Why Content Marketing Fails</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/randfish" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin</a></strong></div>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s great advice but isn&rsquo;t this an email marketing blog?&rdquo; And you are absolutely correct. I took Rand&rsquo;s five mistakes and altered them to apply directly to email marketers.</p>
<h2>1. You believed the biggest myth email marketing ever told the world.</h2>
<p>Email marketing is the pinnacle of permission-based marketing. This means you have the privilege, not the right, to communicate with prospects, leads and customers. It&rsquo;s the #1 reason we see email marketers fail and the #1 reason we see them succeed. As <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a> says, it&rsquo;s all about building trust and earning respect.</p>
<blockquote><p>It recognizes the new power of the best consumers to ignore marketing. It realizes that treating people with respect is the best way to earn their attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Respect the inbox, deliver value and you can succeed.</p>
<h2>2. You waited too long to hit send.</h2>
<p>Rand&rsquo;s second mistake (You made content without a community) is actually just the opposite for email marketers. While content is designed to spread and be shared, email is designed to deliver a message and prompt action. Because the goals are different, an email marketing program can be very successful with just a handful of subscribers. Don&rsquo;t wait until you have 5,000 people on your list to start sending emails. If you are starting a blog, kick off your weekly email newsletter right away. If you are launching a new product, start building interest months before it launches.</p>
<p>Copyblogger has popularized the idea of the <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/unfair-business-advantage/">minimum viable audience</a>, which applies perfectly to this lesson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re receiving enough feedback from comments, emails, social networks, and social media news sites in order to adapt and evolve your content to better serve the audience.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Send, adapt, repeat.</strong></p>
<h2>3. You invested in email creation, but not in list growth.</h2>
<p>In other words, you are sending emails regularly, but you aren&rsquo;t growing your database. Hopefully, you are learning from feedback &ndash; analytics, unsubscribe rates and anecdotal evidence &ndash; how to make your emails better. But as we discussed earlier, emails don&rsquo;t spread in the same way content does. A great piece of content can bring new readers to your site but a great email likely won&rsquo;t add people to your list. For this reason, you need to invest time in both creating great emails and adding people to your list.</p>
<p>This comes down to carefully placing calls to action in the right places. For some, this could mean a pop-up or interstitial ad and for others, it means including them organically in your content. There are no right or wrong answers, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of offering a value proposition to your site&rsquo;s visitors. If the value of the content is high enough, people might simply want to be notified when there are new articles. Often, e-books and reports are good ways to grow an email list. Experiment with forms, surveys, ads, landing pages, social media and video to see what prompts visitors to act but whatever you do, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">please don&rsquo;t cannibalize your content</a>.</p>
<h2>4. You ignored email marketing&rsquo;s two most powerful channels: transactional and behavioral email.</h2>
<p>Email marketing is <strong>so much</strong> more than coupons and newsletters. In fact, email marketing has gotten a bad rap from the many companies who have abused the privilege of inbox access. Consumers are wise to those tactics and wary of companies who bombard them with email.</p>
<p>Smart marketers take email to the next level. This starts with automated drip campaigns that slowly expose new users or prospects to new content, products and services. But that is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Transactional emails &ndash; like receipts, invoices, reminders, notifications, password changes and confirmation emails &ndash; have significantly higher open rates. More importantly, they serve a specific purpose and contain data that readers are genuinely interested in. It&rsquo;s time more marketers took advantage of this opportunity. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hack-transactional-emails/">Much more on that here.</a></p>
<p>Really smart marketers are actually tracking user behavior on their site and sending super-targeted messages based on that behavior. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/6-lessons-you-can-learn-from-amazons-killer-email-marketing/">Amazon is the master of this</a> but anyone can use this strategy now. How? <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/">Tools like Vero, that&rsquo;s how.</a></p>
<h2>5. You gave up way too soon.</h2>
<p>Rand nailed this one but again, it&rsquo;s different for content marketing and email marketing. In content marketing, you need time to grow an audience, build authority with search engines and gain momentum on social media. For email marketers, the passage of time must coincide with the rapid application of changes based on feedback. That&rsquo;s a fancy way of saying email marketers should always be testing new copy, subject lines and segmentation, and making changes based on what they learn.</p>
<p>Constant testing is the best way to get your emails opened and clicked more. If you are simultaneously creating better emails and growing your email lists, the value derived from your email marketing efforts will skyrocket. Then you get unicorns.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em>&ldquo;Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a></em></p>
<p>Email is an intimate form of communication. <strong>With great power</strong> &acirc;&#128;&#148; the privilege of inbox access &acirc;&#128;&#148; <strong>comes great responsibility</strong> &acirc;&#128;&#148; the requirement to respect recipients&rsquo; permission by keeping emails valuable, actionable and useful.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to follow a strict checklist before sending any email. Here are nine questions to ask yourself before you hit send.</p>
<p><span id="more-2784"></span></p>
<h2>1. Did I write a killer subject line?</h2>
<p>Your readers get <strong>a lot</strong> of email, so you need great subject lines to grab their attention. On top of that, you need subject lines that <strong>increase value without implying cost</strong>. In other words, you need to let readers know that the content of your email is incredibly useful and won&rsquo;t cost them a cent.</p>
<p>A subject line is your first call to action (CTA), so it must be free of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">friction words</a>. As Joanna Wiebe of Copyhackers explained at <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/authority-intensive-2014/">Authority Intensive</a>, calls to action are like unopened doors: The reason that people don&rsquo;t click is because they are afraid of what&rsquo;s on the other side.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of email you are sending, you want the subject line to make the value of clicking abundantly clear. Here are a few examples from the <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/01/29/email-subject-line-hacks/" target="_blank">Crazy Egg blog</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Where to drink beer right now</li>
<li>How I grew the KissMetrics Blog From 0 to 350,000 readers a month</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s get fat, Boston</li>
</ul><p>And here are a few great ones that ended up in my inbox recently:</p>
<ul><li>Let&rsquo;s get this party started: Activate your Moz account. [From Moz, obviously.]</li>
<li>This is not a mirage (but it will disappear soon). [Petco]</li>
<li>We got this one wrong. We&rsquo;ve adjusted all paid plans: Now add up to 15 blog feeds. [Buffer]</li>
</ul><p>Some studies indicate that subject lines should be short. And it&rsquo;s true that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">subject lines with between four and 15 characters</a> do extremely well. But it&rsquo;s also true that the best emails are really creative and speak directly to the reader. If that means you need a longer subject line, then go for it.</p>
<p>My weekly Quora update has some of my favorite subject lines. All of them are long, and all of them pique my interest.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Need subject line ideas? Take a page out of <a href="https://twitter.com/Quora">@Quora</a>&lsquo;s book <a href="http://t.co/FQXlWNUntv">pic.twitter.com/FQXlWNUntv</a></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Jimmy Daly (@jimmy_daly) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_daly/statuses/466328825371303936">May 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>Marketers should do their own testing to see what works for their audiences. Subject lines are crucial, so be sure you nail them.</p>
<h2>2. Who is this email really from?</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="300px">Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email <em>really</em> from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized. Here&rsquo;s a look at what I mean: <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Bouqs-email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Bouqs-email.png" alt="Bouqs email example" width="1054" height="40"></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Petco-Email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Petco-Email.png" alt="Petco email example" width="1052" height="41"></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tech-Hive-email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tech-Hive-email.png" alt="TechHive email example" width="1057" height="35"></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email-marketing-checklist-mobile.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email-marketing-checklist-mobile.png" alt="mobile email examples" width="300" height="533"></a></p>
<p>To ensure that any available space is used to enticing copy, make sure that your entire email is ready for readers.</p>
<ul><li>Any and all images should contain alt text. Say, for example, you include an image of a cup of coffee. If it were a blog post, you might use some of your target keywords as alt text, but in an email, where SEO is irrelevant, you want to use copy that excites, scares or otherwise engages a reader. For instance, you might use alt text like &ldquo;Ready for a hot cup o&rsquo; joe on us?&rdquo; instead of image_coffee_300.jpg.</li>
<li>Another good reason to personalize emails is that it often shows up in the inbox.</li>
</ul><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Copyblogger-email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Copyblogger-email.png" alt="Copyblogger email example" width="1057" height="39"></a></p>
<ul><li>Please don&rsquo;t start your email with &ldquo;Does this email look weird? Click here.&rdquo; You want to include accessibility options, but this text shows up in my inbox. This email looks great&hellip;</li>
</ul><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vimeo-email-example.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vimeo-email-example.png" alt="Vimeo Email Example" width="640" height="277"></a></p>
<p>&hellip;until you see it in my inbox.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Vimeo-subject-line.png" alt="Vimeo subject line"></p>
<h2>3. Who is this email really to?</h2>
<p>List segmentation is one of the biggest missed opportunities in email marketing. Because it&rsquo;s easy to collect lots of data about folks on our email lists, there is no excuse not to segment based on a number of demographics:</p>
<ul><li>Company size</li>
<li>Annual revenue</li>
<li>Current solution provider (i.e., your competitors)</li>
<li>Job function</li>
</ul><p>We love <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/increase-blog-subscribers/">Qualaroo</a> for simple data collection like this. With Vero&rsquo;s powerful email marketing software, you can send emails based not only on demographic data but also on behavior. For example, you can trigger emails when:</p>
<ul><li>A lead views a product page</li>
<li>A customer leaves items in his or her cart without checking out</li>
<li>A reader visits your blog three times</li>
</ul><p>There are so many ways to customize emails based on events that you can be sure you have a message for every possible user. Here are a few types of emails that should be segmented based on the recipient:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Consider versioning your newsletters for paying customers rather than for leads. Not everyone is in the same place in the buying cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Receipts:</strong> How big was the purchase? <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/">Include relevant calls to action in email receipts</a>, based on transaction history.</li>
<li><strong>Drip campaigns:</strong> Have automated campaigns ready for unique products and solutions as well as different buyer personas.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions:</strong> Your best customers probably don&rsquo;t need a coupon. Save it for the new leads and small customers, and offer your biggest spenders more value.</li>
</ul><h2>4. Is this email personal enough?</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="px">Blanket emails are rarely effective anymore. Then again, too much personalization can be annoying and even downright creepy. <strong>Data is a double-edged sword.</strong> There is a fine line between using personalization to get an email read and making people feel uncomfortable. At some point, personalization starts to have a negative effect. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email-personalization-data-640.png" alt="How much data is too much?"> A good personalization rule of thumb is to only use data that you would also use in person, according to <a href="http://www.luxurydaily.com/personalization-means-walking-a-fine-line-between-helpful-and-intrusive/" target="_blank">Luxury Daily</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Jack Reynolds, executive director of e-commerce for North America at Clinique, said that it, too, tries not to cross the line by showing too much of what it knows about consumers, adding that the interactions should reflect what an in-store salesperson would say.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The more in-depth data can help craft the message and segment lists behind the scenes, but don&rsquo;t flaunt it.</p>
<h2>5. Is the copy perfect?</h2>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t all <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, <a href="http://okdork.com/blog/">Noah Kagan</a> or <a href="http://copyhackers.com/">Joanna Wiebe</a> &acirc;&#128;&#148; they are some of the best copywriters around &acirc;&#128;&#148; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t write a great email. The copy doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but it has to be pretty dang good. Here are a few tips to keep your copy meaningful and effective:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Make every word count.</strong> My friend Tommy Walker over at <a href="http://conversionxl.com/blog/" target="_blank">ConversionXL</a> reminded me the other day that every word should lead the reader to the next word, and every sentence should lead the reader to the next sentence. Don&rsquo;t include sentences or words that simply take up space. Remember, it&rsquo;s harder to write short copy than long copy, so spend time trimming the fat.</li>
<li><strong>Write damn good sentences.</strong> I stole this from Demian Farnworth at Copyblogger, but it&rsquo;s so perfectly put that it must be shared. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from his <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/damn-good-sentences/">post on writing great sentences</a> that everyone should read:<br><blockquote><p>
No sentence can be effective if it contains facts alone. It must also contain emotion, image, logic, and promise.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great example: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Baby shoes: for sale, never worn.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Ernest Hemingway, and that little six-word story is possibly his best (his own estimation, not mine). Why? It&rsquo;s a story selling a pair of shoes &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; shoes with an intense emotional connotation.</p>
<p>See, your sentences don&rsquo;t have to say much &acirc;&#128;&#148; they just have to say the right things. Our imaginations will fill in the blanks.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Be yourself.</strong> Great writing relies entirely on authenticity, especially when it comes to writing copy that sells. Don&rsquo;t try to emulate Seth Godin; simply be yourself, infuse emotion into your copy and keep on practicing.</li>
</ul><h2>6. Does this email go beyond the written word?</h2>
<p>Most content creators spend their time writing words. That&rsquo;s often the foundation of a good content strategy, but there are so many other mediums you can use to grow an audience and convert leads. Podcasts, videos and even tweets are media elements that can easily be embedded in content, including emails. In 2013, just 25 percent of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/video-email-marketing/">marketers used video in their email marketing</a>, yet YouTube videos are 53 percent more effective than television ads. Buffer found that tweets with images increased clicks by 18 percent and retweets by 150 percent. The medium is different, but the idea is the same: Engaging visuals keep people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Take advantage of free stock photos.</strong> We use them all the time in our blog posts and then repurpose the same images for social media and email campaigns. Check out Buffer&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/free-image-sources-list">list of free image sources</a>, as well as Dustin Senos&rsquo; <a href="https://medium.com/design-ux/62ae4bcbe01b">list on Medium</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Embed videos often.</strong> Can&rsquo;t find videos that are relevant to your posts? It&rsquo;s time to make some. The easiest way to get started, especially for SaaS businesses, is to create tutorial videos using screencasting software. We are fans of <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get in on GIFs.</strong> Animated GIFs aren&rsquo;t right for every post, but they can be a fun way to make your content stand out. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/9-killer-email-marketing-mistakes/">See an example here</a>.) Check out <a href="http://giphy.com/">Giphy</a> for tons of free GIFs, and <a href="http://gifbrewery.com/">GIF Brewery</a> if you want to make your own.</li>
<li><strong>Keep an eye on influential Twitter users in your industry.</strong> A good tweet can be embedded in a post or email, giving credit to the original tweeter and link.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>
Where do you place your CTA for the highest click through rate? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CRO&amp;src=hash">#CRO</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/veroapp">@veroapp</a>: <a href="http://t.co/5vPkI3Q6OZ">http://t.co/5vPkI3Q6OZ</a> <a href="http://t.co/S1ieZa1ryJ">pic.twitter.com/S1ieZa1ryJ</a> &acirc;&#128;&#148; Ryan Gum (@ryangum) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryangum/statuses/466523693527883777">May 14, 2014</a>

<h2>7. Does this email include a call to action?</h2>
<p>Emails don&rsquo;t have to convert readers into customers right away; that&rsquo;s what landing pages are for. But emails can be used to drive traffic to landing pages as well as to blog posts, social media accounts, contests, webinars and any number of other things.</p>
<p>Remember that every email should ask recipients to <em>do</em> something. That thing might be as simple as asking readers to forward the email to a friend, or as big as encouraging them to register for a $2,000 conference. If the email is designed to be promotional, stay focused on one CTA so you don&rsquo;t confuse readers with multiple options. If the goal, for example, is getting them signed up for a free trial, stick to that, and resist the temptation to ask them to follow you on Twitter.</p>
<p>We covered this topic in depth in a recent blog post. In it, Lexi Rodrigo covers:</p>
<ul><li>How to convey value in your CTAs</li>
<li>Where to place CTAs for the best conversion</li>
<li>How to use buttons</li>
<li>How to avoid friction words</li>
</ul><p>Rather than repeating it, we recommend <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">reading Lexi&rsquo;s full article here</a>.</p>
<h2>8. Is this email responsive?</h2>
<p>Responsive emails ensure that your message can easily be read on both a 4-inch smartphone and a 27-inch desktop computer. Luckily, responsive HTML templates solve this problem &acirc;&#128;&#148; meaning you don&rsquo;t need to know a lick of code to create beautiful emails.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/54-email-marketing-resources/">massive list of email marketing resources</a>, we linked to a number of good resources for HTML emails.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/html-email-templates/" target="_blank">HTML emails</a> aren&rsquo;t <em>always</em> the right approach, but they will give your messages a beautiful look and feel. There are <em>so many</em> options to choose from. Here are our three favorite places for HTML email templates.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://themeforest.net/category/marketing/email-templates" target="_blank">ThemeForest</a>: There are more than 600 email designs here. They aren&rsquo;t free, but for between $6 and $20, you can purchase some beautiful designs. Nearly all of these are mobile responsive, but confirm before you buy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/templates/all/" target="_blank">Campaign Monitor</a>: With more than 100 free templates, this is a gold mine for email marketers. Browse through their designs, or <a href="http://i3.campaignmonitor.com/assets/files/templates/complete_package-updated.zip?_ga=1.163551612.1998660057.1395775364" target="_blank">download them all right now</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Mashable curated a handy list of <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/08/email-responsive-design/" target="_blank">free mobile-responsive templates</a>. If you have another good source of email templates, let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>Another option is to use plain text. HTML emails sometimes give off the wrong vibe &acirc;&#128;&#148; they feel promotional &acirc;&#128;&#148; while plain text emails feel very personal. They also have the advantage of being naturally responsive.</p>
<p>Noah Kagan uses this strategy to great effect:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/noah-kagan-email.png" alt="Noah Kagan Email Example"></p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with plain text and HTML. Just make sure that anyone can read your email on any device.</p>
<h2>9. Am I growth hacking?</h2>
<p>Always ask yourself this question. Always.</p>
<p>Why? Because small changes can have a massive impact on traffic, social sharing and conversion. At its roots, growth hacking is essentially thinking outside the box. Here are a few ways to start growth hacking your emails today:</p>
<ul><li>Link to your social media accounts in every email.</li>
<li>Make your transaction emails more interesting by offering upsells, deals and links to useful content.</li>
<li>Ask readers to refer customers in exchange for a discount.</li>
<li>Turn your receipts and billing notifications into <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/">sales tools</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/online-marketing-strategies-partnerships/">Partner with peers</a> to grow your email list faster and drive affiliate sales.</li>
<li>Clean your lists of inactive users. It keeps your spam score low and gives you better data.</li>

<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s an important truth that few people who&rsquo;ve &ldquo;made it&rdquo; in their industry want to talk about. But in my experience, it&rsquo;s essential to success.</p>
<p>What is it? Mindset.</p>
<p>Success is first experienced in the mind before it becomes a reality. This may sound kind of metaphysical, but all I mean is: Before you start acting like a pro, you will have to think like a pro.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Growth Hackers isn&rsquo;t technically a blog &ndash; it&rsquo;s a community &ndash; it is a fantastic resource for marketers. Users can submit and vote on content, meaning the best and most interesting stuff is always at the top.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Groove-HQ.png" alt="">Groove</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmturnbull" target="_blank">@alexmturnbull</a></h2>

<p>Freelancing has become an industry of its own. Now that people can work anywhere, anytime, companies looking to invest in content marketing can essentially buy Content as a Service. It&rsquo;s a great model, but freelancers often lack the business skills to maximize their earning potential. This blog solves that issue.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="https://www.helpscout.net/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/help-scout.png" alt="">Help Scout</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/helpscout" target="_blank">@helpscout</a></h2>
<p>Customer support = marketing. (<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/zappos-art-of-culture/" target="_blank">Just ask Zappos.</a>) Help Scout knows a thing or two about customer support, and their blog shows other companies how to turn support into sales.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hubspot.jpg" alt="">HubSpot</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/HubSpot" target="_blank">@hubspot</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how seriously HubSpot takes content marketing: They hired rock star journalist <a href="http://contentscience.org/2014/02/journalism-content-marketing-collide/" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a> to run their blog. This is a media platform, loaded with content on all things inbound marketing.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://inbound.org/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/inbound-org.png" alt="">Inbound.org</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/Inboundorg" target="_blank">@inboundorg</a></h2>
<p>In the same vein as Growth Hackers, Inbound.org isn&rsquo;t technically a blog. It was co-founded by the fine folks at Moz and Hubspot, and has grown into a flourishing community of marketers sharing the best content they can find.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://insideintercom.io/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/intercom-io.jpg" alt="">Inside Intercom</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/intercom" target="_blank">@intercom</a></h2>

<p>Video marketing is often neglected by startup marketers because of the high cost of professional video.

<html><body><p>&ldquo;Lots of people ask how we manage to create great content and email campaigns here at Vero with such a small team.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, here&rsquo;s the answer:</p>
<ul><li>We&rsquo;re incredibly focused on <strong>consistency</strong>. We post to our blog at least once a week, we automate our quality emails and we talk to customers at least every two weeks.</li>
<li>We <strong>plan ahead</strong>. Good work doesn&rsquo;t happen over night: it takes time!</li>
<li>We review <strong>all</strong> of our campaigns and <strong>automate what works</strong>.</li>
</ul><p>Here&rsquo;s our traffic over the last few months:</p>

<p>As you can see, we&rsquo;ve really started to crank things up a notch: all thanks to the power of email and content. It really pays off.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive and see how we manage our email marketing and content output here at Vero and give you <strong>3 tips to better manage your own email and content campaigns</strong> that you can use immediately.</p>
<p><span id="more-1626"></span></p>
<h2 id="1.-plan-ahead">1. Plan ahead</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going <strong>optimise</strong> your email marketing then the most important thing is <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://todaymade.com/blog/writing-a-great-blog/">Consistency is absolutely king</a> when it comes to content marketing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple: commit to a timeframe (e.g. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to send at least one promotional email per week&rdquo;) and do it!</p>
<p>This allows you to look beyond each individual post and email you create and look at why you did or did not perform. Rather than getting bummed when this week&rsquo;s experiment failed you can focus on the post you <strong>have</strong> to produce next week: this perspective allows you to learn from everything that you do and then actually <em>apply</em> this learning.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t post consistently then it&rsquo;s very easy to get despondent or focus on one particular failure.</p>
<p>Great consistency comes with thinking ahead. I use Trello and I break it down int three important Trello boards:</p>
<ol><li>&ldquo;Marketing &ndash; Blog Posts&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Marketing &ndash; Email Newsletters&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Marketing &ndash; Design&rdquo;</li>
</ol><p>These are clearly pretty self-explanatory. Blog posts go in the &lsquo;blog&rsquo; board, email marketing campaigns (promotional, produce updates, etc.) get planned and executed from the &lsquo;newsletters&rsquo; board and design has tasks that support both of these, allowing our designer to produce the icons and graphics needed for our campaigns and content.</p>
<p>To show you how this is setup, here&rsquo;s a shot of our email marketing board:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1634" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/how-the-founder-of-vero-manages-email-marketing/trello-board-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?fit=1448%2C817&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1448,817" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="trello-board-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?fit=1024%2C578&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1634" alt="trello-board-email-marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png" width="1448" height="817" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?w=1448&amp;ssl=1 1448w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?resize=1024%2C578&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?resize=177%2C100&amp;ssl=1 177w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trello-board-email-marketing.png?resize=75%2C42&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>As you can see, we try to plan about one month in advance. There are four different types of email campaigns that get logged on this board:</p>
<ol><li>Partner promotion</li>
<li>Product updates</li>
<li>Emails to paying customers (notifications, usually)</li>

<p>This board follows a similar pattern: we plan week-by-week and aim to be a month of ahead of today. Blog posts take a lot of work to pull together and there are no real tricks here: the board is a vital place to catalog blog post ideas and then evolve them over time until they have a place on our roadmap. Each ticket itself ends up having a todo a bit like this:</p>

<p>So, my top tips for planning ahead are:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Write down ALL of your ideas</strong>: that way you always have a pool of thoughts to draw from for your marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to the plan</strong>. The whole point of should spend time planning and base it around a hypothesis. Follow the plan, review, learn and then adjust what you do going forward.</li>
<li><strong>Share tasks</strong> for efficiency! If you&rsquo;re a team of one, this means breaking tasks down so that you can tackle them one at a time: usually with a nice break in between!</li>
</ol><h2 id="2.-use-different-types-of-email-campaigns-for-success">2. Use different types of email campaigns for success</h2>
<p>When breaking down our email marketing campaigns, there are three primary ways I think about our campaigns:</p>
<h3 id="1.-blog-post-updates">1. Blog post updates</h3>
<p>These are email campaigns that are sent with the release of each new blog post and use a standard template. I customise the content personally eaech week with some copy and updated links to the newest post.</p>
<p>From time-to-time we experiment with the format of our blog post newsletters, but for the most past ours look like this:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1637" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/how-the-founder-of-vero-manages-email-marketing/newsletters/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?fit=959%2C977&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="959,977" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="newsletters" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?fit=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?fit=959%2C977&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1637" alt="newsletters" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg" width="959" height="977" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?w=959&amp;ssl=1 959w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?resize=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1 294w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?resize=98%2C100&amp;ssl=1 98w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?resize=50%2C50&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/newsletters.jpg?resize=75%2C75&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px"></p>
<p>Based on testing we&rsquo;ve done to date, this one is the winner. Week to week, I don&rsquo;t focus incessantly on these campaigns.</p>
<h2 id="2.-promotional-newsletters">2. Promotional newsletters</h2>
<p>I think of a promotional newsletter as an email that <strong>is not</strong> a blog post update and <strong>is not</strong> automated. This is where I find we <em>really</em> get to test things out.</p>
<p>Getting inspiration for promotional newsletters can come from anywhere, but I use <strong>two primary approaches</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, I think about the segments of customers in our database at that moment. Blog subscribers, <a href="http://pages.getvero.com/the-marketers-email-conversion-course/">email marketing course</a>, trial users, paying customers, etc.</p>
<p>If there are a lot of &lsquo;trial customers&rsquo; that haven&rsquo;t &lsquo;activated&rsquo; then I&rsquo;ll think about how I might entice them to start a new trial or use a new feature we&rsquo;ve released.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wanting to ensure paying customers see some new value in Vero then I&rsquo;ll send them detail on a new product feature they&rsquo;ve never used. For example, if a cohort of customers were found to have used automated campaigns but not our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/new-product-feature-external-attributes/">external attribute</a> feature I&rsquo;d send something introducing them to that feature.</p>
<p>I like to think about promotional newsletters in this way as it is the perfect way to ensure the right person gets the <strong>right message</strong>. If I begin by thinking about the target audience I find I&rsquo;m more likely to come up with a campaign that suits them. Otherwise I&rsquo;m just trig to fit a square peg in a round hole!</p>
<p>To support my theory, here&rsquo;s the average number of emails received by each individual Vero subscriber over the past 4 months:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1638" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/how-the-founder-of-vero-manages-email-marketing/avg-email-per-sub-per-week/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?fit=676%2C500&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="676,500" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="avg-email-per-sub-per-week" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?fit=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?fit=676%2C500&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1638" alt="avg-email-per-sub-per-week" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg" width="676" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?w=676&amp;ssl=1 676w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?resize=135%2C100&amp;ssl=1 135w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?resize=50%2C37&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/avg-email-per-sub-per-week.jpg?resize=75%2C55&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px"></p>
<p>As you can see it has gone up, but certainly not dramatically. What is interesting is to compare this rather minor change with the <strong>huge change in conversion rates</strong> from our email campaigns over the same period.</p>
<p>In Octoober 2013 we had a email to trial conversion rate of around 2%. That means, of all the emails we sent, 2% of recipients ultimately converted to the goal we were aiming for.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t bad but, by the end of January 2014, this number was 7.82%, which is a <strong>450% increase</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, if a 450% increase doesn&rsquo;t prove that using segments are invaluable, then I don&rsquo;t know what does.</p>
<p>My second source of inspiration is a &lsquo;swipe file&rsquo;. I maintain a label in my Gmail called &lsquo;Example Emails&rsquo; and I add emails to this by signing up to lots (and lots) of different email newsletters and trials.</p>
<p>If you want a simple way to maintain a label and do this too, make sure you subscribe to newsletters or company&rsquo;s by slightly adjusting your email like this: &lsquo;<a href="mailto:chris+test@getvero.com">chris+test@getvero.com</a>&lsquo; or &lsquo;<a href="mailto:your.name+newsletter@gmail.com">your.name+newsletter@gmail.com</a>&lsquo;. You can then create a filter in Gmail like this:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1639" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/how-the-founder-of-vero-manages-email-marketing/gmail-filter/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?fit=798%2C402&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="798,402" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gmail-filter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?fit=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?fit=798%2C402&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1639" alt="gmail-filter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png" width="798" height="402" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?w=798&amp;ssl=1 798w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?resize=199%2C100&amp;ssl=1 199w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?resize=50%2C25&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-filter.png?resize=75%2C38&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"></p>
<p>That labels all of the incoming emails you&rsquo;ve signed up to <strong>automatically</strong>. Whenever you need inspiration you can pop into this label and see what sorts of campaigns you&rsquo;ve been receiving and what ideas you might be able to test.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to test though: just because something worked for someone else <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/3-supposed-best-practices-in-email-optimisation-debunked/">doesn&rsquo;t mean the status quo will work for you</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3.-automated-campaigns">3. Automated campaigns</h3>
<p>My approach to <strong>email automation</strong> is to test first and implement permanently later.</p>
<p>Using newsletters allows me to test out ideas <em>quickly</em> and then implement those ideas that work. into automated campaigns. This way the effect is permanent!</p>
<p>For example, I recently found that a newsletter we sent out to blog subscribers and <a href="http://pages.getvero.com/the-marketers-email-conversion-course/">Marketer&rsquo;s Email Conversion Course</a> graduates was a real hit. This campaign was pretty simple: it asked if the recipients would like to start a Vero free trial to put what they&rsquo;d learnt into practice.</p>

<p>Further to this, we recently researched which blog posts and blog post update emails converted better then others.</p>
<p>With these two successful experiments under our belts and backed up with data, we decided to automated two more emails to new Vero blog subscribers:</p>
<p>We now send subscribers our best ever article first (it looks like a standard blog newsletter) and then follow up with a specific call to action telling them about Vero&rsquo;s free trial.</p>
<p>The result: instant success. Both campaigns provide conversions we may well have missed out on previously and faster than we ever could have received them before.</p>
<p>Moreover the first of these two emails has a nearly 50% open rate and 18% click-through rate, which is really phenomenal.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to be tested here but the main takeaway is that you should always focus on trying to get sound numbers before automating. There is no point automating a flawed system so never get too caught up in building the &lsquo;perfect funnel&rsquo; from the word go: start small with your automated campaigns, test some newsletters and then go big.</p>
<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p>Learning from your campaigns is the most important aspect of the email marketing process.</p>
<p>Each week I spend time reviewing the email campaigns we sent out in the last 7 days in order to develop a plan to implement in the coming week.</p>
<p>To measure success I focus on a single metric and, in most cases, this is getting customers to sign up for a free trial.</p>
<p>There are two ways that I find this data. The first is using Google Analytics. As I use Vero, I can append the campaign subject line as a utm_campaign (i.e. Vero does this for me automatically). That makes it super easy to see how each campaign has gone with all the events and goals I have in GA:</p>

<p>The alternate way (and I like to cross-reference) is using Vero&rsquo;s conversions column itself. Each and every campaign I send in Vero has a specific goal and Vero automatically reports the results of a campaign against this goal.</p>

<p>From the example above (in point two) referencing our new automated emails &ndash; as part of our blog welcome series &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to see the number of people that reach a specific goal for a campaign. In the case of that campaign it is to sign up for a free trial. This is also super useful when running A/B tests as it makes it easy to see, at a glance, how effective each campaign and campaign variation is.</p>
<p>Remember: looking beyond opens and clicks is super important. Make sure you track conversions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pulling together great email campaigns takes time and thought but it <strong>pays off massively</strong>.</p>
<p>Staying organised will ensure that you not only send better emails but learn more from each and every campaign, improving your learning rapidly.</p>

<p>Emirates kicks off the list with this email, sent a few weeks before an international departure. By using their data they have singled out customers that are a) traveling a long distance, b) traveling economy, c) traveling soon and d) on an aircraft with and upgrade available. The copy to &lsquo;make us an offer&rsquo; likely gets a lot of click-throughs: it&rsquo;s different from the usual &lsquo;Pay $X to upgrade now&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t forget that using a future activity as the trigger point for an email is a great opportunity to upsell or re-engage customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a> send out this awesome email when you create your fifth &lsquo;pad&rsquo;. In the Hackpad world this is a sign of activation: it&rsquo;s a sign you&rsquo;re fully engaged with the product.</p>
<p>Every SaaS company should be sending something like this. Not only does it congratulate the recipient but it encourages them to check out another popular feature. This not only gets them back to Hackpad&rsquo;s site but is genuinely helpful and encourages the customer to try something they may not have used yet. If they like it, there&rsquo;s every chance they&rsquo;ll be a customer sooner and for longer.</p>

<p>If you take a call on <a href="http://clarity.fm">Clarity.fm</a>, the savvy marketers there will be sure to follow up with this email campaign. When developing your lifecycle emails it&rsquo;s important to reflect on Dave McClure&rsquo;s infamous <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/06/internet-market.html">AARRR</a> metrics.</p>
<p>Clarity nails the <em>retention</em> &lsquo;R&rsquo; with this email. For anyone that has had a call via Clarity, you&rsquo;ll know that there is often a ton of follow-up questions and &lsquo;homework&rsquo; coming out of your calls. This email takes advantage of that fact and is a genuinely useful reminder to touch base with the mentors you&rsquo;ve spoken to.</p>

<p>A great data-driven email, YouTube used this email to target customers that had watched any of 2013&rsquo;s trending videos. The goal here is to get viewers that would be considered &lsquo;tastemakers&rsquo; or &lsquo;influencers&rsquo; to re-watch something they may have enjoyed early in the year and get them to share it again, perhaps even to &lsquo;brag&rsquo; that they&rsquo;d seen it first.</p>

<p>This is a simple email. It&rsquo;s not sexy, it doesn&rsquo;t even have a digital call to action&hellip;but there is something magical about the way the physical device on my wrist virtually sends me a reminder when it&rsquo;s battery is low.</p>

<p>Mouseflow helps you track your customers&rsquo; on-site mouse movements. They have to ensure their customers install Javascript on their website and they use this campaign to help get them over the line. This is more unique than other activation emails we&rsquo;ve seen recently as the call to action asks customers to &lsquo;claim their bonus&rsquo;. In a way, the bonus is artificial. It&rsquo;s designed to get customers installed faster and it&rsquo;s worth it to Mouseflow to reward the users that do install the Javascript with a little extra as, ultimately, there&rsquo;s a much higher chance they&rsquo;ll activate than if they don&rsquo;t get the Javascript installed at all.</p>

<p>If, at any point, you use LinkedIn&rsquo;s Address Book import feature then you&rsquo;ll notice a list of LinkedIn contacts that &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t yet on LinkedIn&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If any of these contacts every join, you&rsquo;ll get an email like the one above. The idea is to help seed the new user&rsquo;s profile with a flurry of new contacts straight away, as well to increase your own network. A win-win for you, the new use and LinkedIn, this is a quality campaign.</p>

<p>At Vero, we use Facebook&rsquo;s retargeting and ad features, though sparingly. This campaign from Facebook appears to have been targeted after I had not logged into our Facebook business account for a period.</p>
<p>All three calls to action lead to the exact same page: a guide for getting started with Facebook&rsquo;s ad targeting tools. The focus and aim of this campaign are perfect for B2B lifecycle email. Targeting customers that are active users but may have gone a little quiet or <strong>have not</strong> used a particular feature is the perfect way to build up engagement or make more money.</p>

<p>The following email from BigCommerce was sent just before Christmas. We&rsquo;ve got a few demo accounts for BigCommerce for testing. This campaign gets a mention, not because it&rsquo;s particularly data-driven in it&rsquo;s copy, but because of BigCommerce&rsquo;s approach to it&rsquo;s delivery.</p>
<p>Check out these from addresses:</p>

<p>CodeClimate is a very useful application for a company built on technology. Their notification emails are great for two reasons: 1. they&rsquo;re clear and direct, and 2. they don&rsquo;t make you go back to the website to get value from them. This particular example is twice as good, as the team at CodeClimate have dynamically inserted a notification that your trial is about to expire. This is how you should be doing trigger-based, transactional email.</p>

<p>Pocket&rsquo;s year-end email is reminiscent of LinkedIn&rsquo;s <a>top 5% of user&rsquo;s campaign</a> last year. The copy of the email gives it a personal touch despite the fact that Pocket has over 7.5 million users, making the top 1% a rather large 74,000. Using data to create a personal message is powerful and there is no doubt you could use your own data to create an email just like this.</p>

<p>Another example from Fitbit (crushing it here) is this 2013 summary email. Pulling data for each and every customer and combining it with some cheeky copy gives this campaign a unique feel. &ldquo;A turtle would take <em>364</em> days to skateboard that fast&rdquo; is a fantastic way to present data and a great example of fun copy.</p>
<p>How can you combine a positive, fun tone with customer data to create something different?</p>

<p>Paypal have been working extremely hard over the last year to improve their branding and online toolset. This email is an interesting one. It was triggered when the account had a positive balance that had not been touched for a while. The call to action is a little vague but this is an effective email to remind inactive customers that <strong>do</strong> have the ability to make purchases or send money that they shouldn&rsquo;t forget about their Paypal balance.</p>
<p>How can you target inactivity and segment out users that can take positive action <strong>immediately</strong>?</p>
