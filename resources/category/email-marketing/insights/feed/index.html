<html><body><p>Sorting through dozens of emails in my junk folder recently, I found a number of emails that I asked to receive and clearly weren&rsquo;t spam. Are spam filters doing their job?</p>
<p>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but spam filters inevitably snag some emails that should be delivered. According to Marketing Sherpa, spam filters mistakenly block one in six emails. <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/deliverability/spam-filters/about-spam-filters">Other estimates</a> are worse, with aggressive spam blockers filtering out up to 20% of permission-based emails.</p>
<p>So chances are, some of your emails are probably being kept out of your subscribers&rsquo; inboxes.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to share some of the ways you can improve the deliverability of your marketing emails, considering five areas:</p>
<ol><li>Email Service Provider</li>
<li>List Quality</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ol><p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at each one:</p>
<h2>1. Email Service Provider</h2>
<p>A good Email Service Provider (ESP) helps you maintain your sender reputation. According to a <a href="http://blog.eloqua.com/email-deliverability-best-practices">Return Path study</a>, 83% of the time, sender reputation, not content, is the major factor that caused emails to get filtered.</p>
<p>Your ESP helps enhance your sender reputation by doing things like authenticating the IP address your emails are sent from, setting up a feedback loop, and automatically unsubscribing anyone who marks your emails as spam. Through spam scoring, your ESP will also help you create emails that are less likely to raise red flags with spam blockers.</p>
<p>Be sure to choose a reputable ESP and keep in mind that if you send your emails from your own server, then you will have to do all this yourself.</p>
<h2>2. List Quality</h2>
<p>The quality of your list also affects your email deliverability. Only send emails to people who have given you permission to do so. Don&rsquo;t buy email lists! <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/grow-your-email-list/">Grow your lists organically</a> by offering value in your content and <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/get-more-email-subscribers-how-we-doubled-email-signups">asking for permission</a> to communicate via email.</p>
<p>Inactive subscribers are also a concern. Even if they opted into your list and gave you permission to email them, &ldquo;emotionally unsubscribed&rdquo; recipients can cause problems. They lower your open and click rates, for one thing. They may even forget they signed up for your mailing list and tag your email as spam.</p>
<p>One way to handle inactive subscribers is to send an email to those who haven&rsquo;t opened or clicked on your emails for the last 12 months. Ask them to confirm if they&rsquo;re still interested in receiving your emails. If not, then unsubscribe them (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-hacks/">see growth hack #10</a>) or give them the option to receive emails less frequently.</p>
<p>If they do unsubscribe, remind them they could interact with you on social media instead. Keeping your list healthy by maintaining only subscribers who are truly interested in your messages is a good way to protect your email deliverability.</p>
<h2>3. Content</h2>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that sender reputation is more significant than the actual content of an email. Yet email content continues to be important. It&rsquo;s easy for you to control the content of your marketing emails, so why not do what you can to minimize getting filtered out by spam blockers?</p>
<p>Here are some things to watch out for:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;From&rdquo; Field Name and Address</h3>
<p>Avoid sending your emails from generic email addresses like support@mycompany.com or info@mycompany.com. A specific person&rsquo;s email address is best.</p>
<h3>Subject Line</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make your subject line look spammy. Avoid using ALL CAPS and exclamation points!!! Don&rsquo;t use weird punctuation marks like this: @#$%*!.</p>
<h3>Spam Words</h3>
<p>For both the email body and subject line, watch out for words and phrases spam filters like to block out. Some of these are obvious but others aren&rsquo;t:</p>
<ul><li>Sex</li>
<li>Drugs</li>
<li>Viagra</li>
<li>For free</li>
<li>No cost</li>
<li>Accept credit cards</li>
<li>Cancel at any time</li>
<li>Consolidate debt and credit</li>
<li>Act now! Don&rsquo;t hesitate!</li>
<li>Get it now</li>
<li>Congratulations</li>
<li>Call free</li>
<li>Call now</li>
<li>Lowest price</li>
<li>Opportunity</li>
<li>Free access</li>
<li>Order status</li>
<li>Money making</li>
<li>Pennies a day</li>
<li>Please read</li>
<li>Free quote</li>
<li>Free sample</li>
<li>Free trial</li>
<li>No cost</li>
</ul><p>You can find a research-based list of spam words <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/those-forbidden-spam-words.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before sending an email, use your ESP&rsquo;s spam score checker to identify elements that could set off spam alerts in your recipients&rsquo; ISPs.</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Did you know images could get your email blocked? Using too many images in your email, without balancing them with text, or emails that are purely made up of a single image, could get your email to be flagged as spam.</p>
<p>Even where you host your image could be an issue. You should only use reputable image hosting services, your own server (assuming your domain name isn&rsquo;t blacklisted), or your ESP&rsquo;s image hosting.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>Keep a close eye on links within your email. Include too many links and your email could land in the spam folder. Also, make sure you&rsquo;re not linking to blacklisted websites. To find out if a particular domain you&rsquo;re linking to is blacklisted, use one of the <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/8-ways-find-google-list-blacklisted-sites/">free blacklist checkers</a> online.</p>
<h3>Anti-Spam Laws</h3>
<p>Comply with anti-spam law requirements in your country. For example, I live in Canada, and the Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation says each commercial email must have a clearly identified sender and include the sender&rsquo;s mailing address, phone number, and email or web address. Find out what requirements apply to you and make sure each and every email you send adheres to them.</p>
<h2>4. Engagement</h2>
<p>Another factor that affects your email deliverability is your subscribers&rsquo; level of engagement. The more subscribers open your emails, click on your links, and reply to your messages, the less likely your future emails are going to be flagged as spam.</p>
<p>You can try a few simple tips to increase engagement with your emails, and get them whitelisted by your subscribers&rsquo; email platforms:</p>
<ul><li>Use a double opt-in process to ensure that subscribers are really interested in receiving your emails.</li>
<li>Ask subscribers to add your sender email address to their email address book. Do this as soon as they opt into your list.</li>
<li>Get subscribers to reply to your very first email. A good way is to ask them a question in the first email you send them. Make the question relevant and easy to answer. For example, if they just signed up for a list for a digital marketing newsletter, your question could be, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your biggest challenge in digital marketing?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Segment your lists so you always send them extremely targeted, relevant emails. Having a message-to-audience match is a foolproof way of getting your emails opened, read, and acted upon. Vero helps you segment your lists based on how they&rsquo;ve been responding to your previous emails and web content, which lets you send them highly relevant emails.</li>
<li>Send emails regularly. Be consistent when it comes to the frequency of your marketing emails. This is good for engaging your subscribers, because they&rsquo;re more likely to read and respond when they know when to expect your emails. In other words, consuming your emails becomes a habit. Consistency is also less likely to alert ISPs than infrequent massive blasts of email.</li>
</ul><h2>5. Email Maintenance</h2>
<p>Several maintenance tasks help keep your list health in tip-top shape.</p>
<h3>Email metrics</h3>
<p>One of these tasks is to monitor your bounce rates, complaints, and unsubscribes. According to <a href="http://blog.eloqua.com/email-deliverability-best-practices">Eloqua</a>, these are the thresholds to aim for:</p>
<ul><li>Bounce rates should be under 3%. Immediately remove email addresses that bounce as undeliverable.</li>
<li>Complaints (subscribers who flag your email as spam) should be kept below 0.01%.</li>
<li>Unsubscribe rates should be below 1%.</li>
</ul><p>Every time an email exceeds these thresholds for complaints and unsubscribes, step back and analyze what could have caused the negative response. Was your email too pushy? Have you been sending one promotional email after another? Or has it been too long since your last email? Was the message targeted or potentially irrelevant?</p>
<p>Again, your EPS&rsquo;s spam scoring tool will alert you on other possible red flags.</p>
<h3>Email deliverability monitoring</h3>
<p>You should also be monitoring your email deliverability, even though your ESP may already be doing so. A simple way is by creating seed addresses. These are mailboxes in email providers your subscribers use often, such as Gmail, Hotmail, etc. Create five email addresses for each provider and add these addresses to your mailing lists. Every time you send a marketing email, check these email accounts to see which ones got through and which ones ended up in the spam folder.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a diagram showing the perilous path of a marketing email from you to your recipient&rsquo;s inbox (or not). It shows how many possible stumbling blocks could keep your emails from reaching their intended destination:</p>

<html><body><p>If you sell a subscription online or run a SaaS business, then you will regularly be asking customers to upgrade and, odds on, you&rsquo;ll be doing so via email.</p>
<p>There are a <strong>lot</strong> of things you need to get right before a customer is ready to upgrade and start a subscription but, assuming that you <strong>have</strong> moved your customers through your funnel successfully, <strong>how should you write your upgrade email</strong>?</p>
<p>I am going to share a <strong>great</strong> example I received recently and, with a little deconstruction, we can determine why this email works so well and what lessons we you can apply to your own upgrade emails.</p>
<h2>Show me the copy!</h2>
<p>To get the ball rolling, here&rsquo;s a copy of the upgrade email I received from Emil at <a href="http://helpjuice.com" target="_blank">Helpjuice</a>, <strong>marked up with everything I think it gets right</strong>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4286" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/secret-to-upgrade-emails/upgrade-email-example/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?fit=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,900" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="upgrade-email-example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4286" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png" alt="upgrade-email-example" width="1200" height="900" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/upgrade-email-example.png?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<h2>What works here</h2>
<p>I recently mentioned another of Emil&rsquo;s emails my post sharing <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/03/20/examples-retention-emails/">five killer examples of email remarketing</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say I&rsquo;ve become a big fan of Helpjuice&rsquo;s approach to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-guide/campaign-strategy/" target="_blank">lifecycle marketing</a> throughout my free trial but my favourite three things about <strong>this</strong> particular email are:</p>
<ol><li>Emil gives the recipient a <strong>choice</strong>. If you&rsquo;re <strong>not</strong> ready to upgrade then he recommends giving him a call. This is <strong>much warmer</strong> than the usual copy that goes along the lines of &ldquo;Upgrade your account today or we&rsquo;ll delete it!&rdquo;</li>
<li>He provides a good case for <strong>choosing a higher plan</strong> ($99/month) by linking to a very informative article on the <strong>positives of doing so</strong>. He also gets to show off his own product in this way (as that&rsquo;s where the article is hosted).</li>
<li>Emil uses a <strong>personal tone</strong> and includes a <strong>photo of himself</strong>. This approach goes a long way and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/5-conversion-optimization-experts-email-remarketing-campaign-hipchat/">being personal helps build trust</a> as you share your story and your persona with your customers.</li>
</ol><p>There&rsquo;s a lot to like about this email but what else can you do to make it even <strong>more effective</strong>?</p>
<h2>How YOU can go one better</h2>
<p>In taking inspiration from Emil&rsquo;s email and giving your upgrade email a facelift, here are a few other ideas that will make this email even more effective:</p>
<ol><li>Include the primary Call To Action (CTA) again at <strong>the bottom of the email</strong>.</li>
<li>Use<strong> social proof</strong>. Write a postscript featuring a positive quote from a customer.</li>
<li>Link <strong>directly to the actual upgrade screen</strong> rather than explain how to get there.</li>
<li>Make the <strong>links clickable</strong>, e.g. &lsquo;To upgrade, simply <strong>visit your control panel</strong> and choose a plan&hellip;&rsquo; as opposed to plaintext.</li>
<li>Have a<strong> benefit-based subject line</strong> such as &ldquo;Keep shaving time off your customer support efforts&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;Your Free Trial Has Nearly Expired&rdquo; or similar.</li>
<li>Try using the term &lsquo;Go pro&rsquo; or <strong>something NON-developer-centric</strong> instead of &lsquo;Upgrade&rsquo; &ndash; thanks Brian Massey for this tip when he and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/5-conversion-optimization-experts-email-remarketing-campaign-hipchat/">four other conversion optimization experts reviewed HipChat&rsquo;s SaaS welcome email</a>).</li>
</ol><h2>Get those upgrades!</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! A short and sweet example of a really effective upgrade email. Definitely jump into your own lifecycle email sequence and incorporate the tips above to <strong>give your upgrade email a little extra power</strong>. After all, this is a fantastic example of the sort of lifecycle email you should be sending your customers.</p>
<p>What do you think &ndash; what extra elements or ideas would you test to improve on Emil&rsquo;s email?</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>At this point, you&rsquo;re <em>much</em> smarter about how <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/video-email-marketing/">videos affect your email marketing</a>, right?</p>
<p>You know it&rsquo;s a great way to set yourself apart and get ahead of the competition. You know it gives you roughly <strong>280 perfect ROI</strong>, which is an added bonus. And you know if all else fails, you can default to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/animated-gifs/">animated GIFs</a>.</p>
<p>But now you&rsquo;re stuck with one question in your head: <em>What do I do next?</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a legitimate question. After all, how in the world are you supposed to get started when there&rsquo;s so much involved in creating videos? You have to come up with a concept, write a script, find acting or voice talent, hire a videographer or buy your own equipment, shoot the scenes, edit the raw footage, add (legal) music/images, etc. And that doesn&rsquo;t even cover how you&rsquo;re supposed to even deliver the video to your email subscribers.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re overwhelmed already, never fear. <strong>This post will cover (nearly) everything you need to start making videos and including them in your emails.</strong></p>
<p>In reality, having access to the technology for making videos means half your battle is fought; now it&rsquo;s just the creation and delivery you need to worry about. Once you know more about the basics of each, you&rsquo;ll find video production far less daunting than you imagined.</p>
<p>So are you ready to give some va-va-voom to your emails with video? Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>
<h3>Take note of a few quick caveats &hellip;</h3>
<p>While we&rsquo;ve done our best in this post to include all the necessary steps to getting videos in your email marketing, we simply couldn&rsquo;t cover each area in-depth. For instance, video production itself is an entire industry and there are varying opinions and systems for how to get things done.</p>
<p>This is a beginner&rsquo;s guide to video and email marketing, and it&rsquo;s more than enough to hook your audience and get you started on the right path. If you want more in-depth answers, you can check out magazines like <a href="http://www.videomaker.com/" target="_blank">Videomaker</a> and <a href="http://www.hdvideopro.com/" target="_blank">HDVideoPro</a>; subscribe to blogs like <a href="http://www.reelseo.com/" target="_blank">ReelSEO</a>, <a href="http://www.vidyard.com/blog/" target="_blank">Vidyard</a>, and <a href="http://www.videobrewery.com/blog" target="_blank">Video Brewery</a>; or take courses from <a href="https://creatorup.com/" target="_blank">CreatorUp!</a> or <a href="http://vidpow.com/" target="_blank">Vidpow</a>.</p>
<p>We also want to warn you to avoid going crazy with embedding videos in your email. Sometimes, videos aren&rsquo;t meant to be shared exclusively within your emails. For example, if you have a landing page video, you can&rsquo;t just include the video in email without also placing it on your landing page. It seems obvious, but these types of videos won&rsquo;t perform as well if you only include them in email.</p>
<p>But in general, what we&rsquo;re talking about in this post has to do with videos you make <em>specifically</em> for your audience to view within email, like a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; video or a quick &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; video about your product. So just make sure you decide on the purpose and goal of your videos before you include them in emails where they may not help you reach those results.</p>
<p>Capiche? Awesome. Now, let&rsquo;s get to the good stuff.</p>
<h2>Learn Some Video Production Basics</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never made a video before, you may be thinking, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any of this technical stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay &ndash; not a lot of technical stuff is needed at this point. What you really need is a basic understanding of how to produce a quality video using the technical items you have.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to make sure you&rsquo;re producing this kind of video:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Start with a solid script.</strong> A compelling script makes or breaks a production. While other production aspects are important, no amount of fancy graphics, high-tech equipment, or celebrity cameos will hold up a script that&rsquo;s unrelatable. You must tell your story in such a way your audience understands exactly why your company can make their lives better; your message must connect on an emotional level. In this way, you&rsquo;re far more likely to drive them to action.By now, you&rsquo;re probably sick of hearing about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/dollar-shave-club/" target="_blank">Dollar Shave Club</a>&lsquo;s promotional video, but there&rsquo;s damn good reason for it. It&rsquo;s all there: an interesting person, quick-witted humor, explanation of a problem, a clear solution, and memorable (yet incredibly simple) visuals. Seriously, re-watch it and tell yourself you&rsquo;re not jealous:

<li><strong>Know what makes your video look good.</strong> An average Internet user expects certain levels of technical quality in a professional business video. They immediately recognize video created in less than 1080p (HD quality); they also know when your audio sounds like you recorded during a hurricane. They really don&rsquo;t like it when your face is light on one side and dark on the other. Oh, and shaky cameras are a no-no (for heaven&rsquo;s sake, use a tripod when you film!). As long as you don&rsquo;t make a video that looks like your 5-year-old accidentally recorded himself on your iPad, you&rsquo;re a step ahead of many businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Find equipment.</strong> Remember when we mentioned there&rsquo;s lots of tech available today to help you make videos? We weren&rsquo;t joking. Video isn&rsquo;t just for Hollywood anymore; now anyone can make great content on a budget.Use the equipment you can afford that gets good reviews. For example, a <a href="http://www.bluemic.com/yeti/">Blue Yeti</a> microphone is a popular, professional-level product for only $150. Most iPhones have HD cameras which will be just fine for a simpler script, and software like <a href="http://www.screencast.com/" target="_blank">Screencast</a> works when you need to record your screen. If you have the budget, you can hire a production company to film your video, or pay an animation service like <a href="http://animoto.com/" target="_blank">Animoto</a> to create an animated video from your script.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to the script&rsquo;s delivery.</strong> You could have written the most compelling, amazing story about your business, but your audience never notices because your acting &ldquo;talent&rdquo; makes the entire production sound like a corporate training video.Make sure whoever does the voice-over for your script has a strong voice, clear diction, and energy in every word. If you&rsquo;re using on-camera acting talent &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s yourself, someone in your company, or an outside hire &ndash; that person must be lively and interesting while not distracting from the content of the script with superfluous hand gestures or an unpowdered, shiny face.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it as short as possible.</strong> <a href="http://wistia.com/blog/does-length-matter-it-does-for-video-2k12-edition">Research shows</a> that audiences expect most online videos from businesses to be around a minute long. Technically, they prefer watching content only 30 seconds long or less. This means you need to save your detailed descriptions and ramblings for landing pages and site copy &hellip; the video is a quick overview hook only.Don&rsquo;t stress, though, if you&rsquo;re not sure you can keep your video to a minute or less. Sacrificing your message for length isn&rsquo;t a good idea, because you&rsquo;ll put false ideas about your business into audience&rsquo;s minds. Again, take the Dollar Shave Club video as an example; while longer than usual at a minute and 30 seconds, it still managed to hold the attention of millions of people around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Include a call-to-action.</strong> Forgetting this will render your video efforts useless. The goal of your video wasn&rsquo;t to just be a fictional piece, right? You wanted your audience to <em>do</em> something when they were done watching? Then include a call-to-action.Think of one thing you want your audience to do, and either have your acting talent state that audibly, or include on-text screen at the very end of the video. If you&rsquo;re hosting the video on an external site (more on that in a bit), make sure you include any relevant links in the description, annotations, or overlays so people are directed to the right location on your site.</li>
</ol><h2>Figure Out Video Delivery Requirements</h2>
<p>Take a moment to pat yourself on the back. You&rsquo;ve just created a video!</p>
<p>Now, how to get it in front of your email subscribers &hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, because that&rsquo;s what these next few sections are about:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Figure out hosting.</strong> This doesn&rsquo;t have to be as technical as it sounds. Basically, when you create a video you need to store that file somewhere online so your email subscribers have access to it. If you&rsquo;re on a limited budget, YouTube and Vimeo have fairly robust free accounts available. However, if you&rsquo;re thinking you&rsquo;ll be making more videos in the future, consider investing in more server space to host your own videos or go with a professional video-hosting service like <a href="http://wistia.com/">Wistia</a>.Even if you don&rsquo;t host your videos on free sites, make sure to place them on (at the very least) YouTube. Putting it on this ever-growing site and optimizing for SEO means you have a high chance of people finding it and taking action. (<em>See slides below.</em>) This is especially true if your video is the kind of visual content people are looking for. Using video keyword research and normal keyword research to find what your audience is interested in means you&rsquo;re far more likely to get traffic back to your site (just make sure you add that call-to-action!).

</li>
<li class=" small-image" style="px"><strong>Create a fall-back image.</strong> Even though more than 50 percent of email service providers now support videos through HTML5, you have a large portion of your audience to worry about. Bottom line: <em>always include a fall-back image</em>.And not just any image. You need a compelling one. This means no boring logos, no images without text, and no images that aren&rsquo;t relevant to the video. Create your fall-back image with the clearly-emblazoned video title with a &ldquo;play&rdquo; icon over top. Insert the image into your email body, and then link to your video externally so people understand it&rsquo;s still a video they can view. Need a good example? Follow in the footsteps of business and lifestyle goddess <a href="http://www.marieforleo.com/">Marie Forleo</a>, who markets her MarieTV episodes in email.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.entrepreneuronfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/maries-email.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></li>
<li><strong>Get to the point &hellip; after a tease.</strong> One of the biggest mistakes you can make when adding video to your emails is plopping it right in the beginning of the communication and assuming your reader will get what it is. You need to give it some context and quick explanation before you embed, otherwise, you&rsquo;re just going to confuse people right off the bat.Your introduction to the video doesn&rsquo;t have to be long. In fact, when I created my free videos for my subscribers, I only included 2-3 paragraphs in each email before I included the video. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t write 300 words or more before your video if you wish. The key is to test what your customers respond best to, and keep repeating that system (doesn&rsquo;t it always come down to testing?).</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for mobile.</strong> For the love of all that is good and holy, <strong>always optimize for mobile</strong>. Stats reveal email is opened on mobile an average of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">48 percent of the time</a>, and it&rsquo;s not likely that percentage will be going down in the near future. You need to make sure whatever video you include in your email marketing campaigns looks good on mobile screens.Start by referencing your stats on the types of devices your customers are using to read your emails. Make a list of all the mobile devices that show up, and test your emails on each device. It can be a joint venture among your colleagues, or you can assign the task to one person; simply adjust what needs fixing. Overall, the process shouldn&rsquo;t take too long, and you don&rsquo;t want to be part of the 32 percent of email marketers without a mobile strategy when 64 percent of decision-makers read email on mobile devices!</li>
</ol><h2>Start Using Video in Email Marketing</h2>
<p>You got this far, which means you learned more than many companies have about videos for email. Now you&rsquo;re that much smarter &ndash; treat yourself to a latte!</p>
<p>Going through all these steps one at a time with a focus on quality execution will ensure your videos are created with at least an intermediate level of production quality. It&rsquo;ll also guarantee they get delivered to your audience properly. There may still be hangups here and there &ndash; rendering, for example, can be a challenge &ndash; but overall you should be set to start using video in your email marketing.</p>
<p>Just remember, creating videos can be big undertaking, but it can also be very rewarding. Have any questions? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<html><body><p>You know the best way to send better email newsletters?</p>
<p>Subscribe to and read <em>lots</em> of them.</p>
<p>Here are 50 great ones to keep tabs on. These may not reach the widest audience <strong>but they resonate with the right audience</strong>. Some are niche, some are general &hellip; but all of them go above and beyond to deliver a great experience. They&rsquo;ve earned to right to be opened based on the sender, not the subject line. (If your emails are good enough over time, people will open them regardless of what the subject says.)</p>
<p>While the content may not be relevant to you, look for ideas on how to better communicate with your own subscribers. Some newsletters, like Help Scout&rsquo;s, contain a single link while other have more than 50. Some are beautifully designed while others have a community bulletin feel to them. There is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to do it, as long as it engages the reader.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy these newsletters. There are obviously more than 50 great ones out there so please let us know what we missed in the comments.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> I really mean when I say subscribe to all 50. I use a filter and label in my Gmail so most of these skip the inbox. When I need inspiration, I have a treasure trove of ideas waiting for me.</em></p>

<html><body><p>Inbox zero.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an achievement celebrated by everyone on Earth, <em>except email marketers</em>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about inbox zero though: It&rsquo;s a real issue for people. <em>Even email marketers get too much email.</em> The collective response from email users &ndash; all 2.4 billion of them &ndash; has been overwhelming. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy" target="_blank">McKinsey &amp; Company</a> reported that workers spend &ldquo;28 percent of the workweek managing e-mail.&rdquo; That works out to just over 11 hours &hellip; more than an entire day of the week</p>
<p><span id="more-3792"></span></p>
<p>Quartz reported that it&rsquo;s taking people longer to respond to emails too, mostly because they are getting so many.</p>
<blockquote><p>On current trends, then, if email response times keep increasing by 10% a year, and assuming that an average postal delivery time in your country is two days, <strong>I estimate that by approximately 2020 it will be faster to get an answer from someone by writing a letter than by sending an email</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Workers also complain that email is a major cause of stress. Tom Jackson, a professor at Loughborough University, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2335699/Is-inbox-making-ill-Reading-work-emails-causes-blood-pressure-heart-rate-soar.html">conducted a study</a> of government workers in the UK. <strong>He found that email caused stress for 92 percent of the people studied.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The findings showed a direct link between email and stress &ndash; and indicated that employees are more prone to increased stress when reading and sending emails.</p>
<p>For example, the majority of participants &ndash; 92 percent &ndash; became fraught, with many recording elevated blood pressure and heart rate readings, during email and phone use.</p></blockquote>
<p>More than a few startups are aiming to kill or transform email. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Mailbox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mailstrom.co/" target="_blank">Mailstrom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://unroll.me/" target="_blank">Unroll.me</a></li>
</ul><p>To summarize the current email landscape, people are just sick of getting so much freaking email. We, the email marketing community, are partially to blame for this.</p>
<p>How can we fix this?</p>
<p>I have a few ideas. Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
<h2>1. Send responsibly.</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="490px"><img data-attachment-id="3803" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/inbox-zero/b5qqz-1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?fit=490%2C275&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="490,275" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Milk was a bad choice" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?fit=490%2C275&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3803" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg" alt="Milk was a bad choice" width="490" height="275" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?w=490&amp;ssl=1 490w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?resize=178%2C100&amp;ssl=1 178w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/b5qqz-1.jpg?resize=75%2C42&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first and most obvious rule of email marketing but it&rsquo;s also the most abused. Not only should you limit the frequency of your emails, you should spend more time segmenting lists and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/behavioral-email-ideas/">sending data-driven behavioral emails</a> rather than &ldquo;blasts&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take Ron Burgundy&rsquo;s word for it though, there is good data supporting the case for sending fewer emails. We analyzed more than 100 million emails send by Vero users and found that frequency has a significant impact on click rates.</p>
<p><strong>In fact, the third email of the week saw a 37 percent drop in click rates.</strong> That&rsquo;s a huge number and sure sign that people are tired of getting your emails.</p>
<p><script id="infogram_0_more-emails--lower-click-rate" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js"></script></p>
<div style="width: 100%; border-top: 1px solid #acacac; padding-top: 3px; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10px; text-align: center;"><a style="color: #acacac; text-decoration: none;" href="//infogr.am/more-emails--lower-click-rate" target="_blank">More emails = lower click rate</a> | <a style="color: #acacac; text-decoration: none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<h2>2. Stop targeting the &ldquo;average&rdquo; subscriber.</h2>
<p>When you send a &ldquo;blast&rdquo; or &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; email, you are targeting the &ldquo;average&rdquo; user. Let&rsquo;s spend a minute talking about the word &ldquo;average&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a math term that refers to the sum of a series of numbers divided by the number of inputs.</p>
<p>So if you have the numbers 4, 17, 41, 65, 83 and 96, the average is 51. The number 51 doesn&rsquo;t appear anywhere in the list, but it is the average of those six numbers.</p>
<p>How does this apply to email marketing?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have 10,000 people on your email marketing list. If you are lucky, 20 percent of them will open an email. The other 80 percent don&rsquo;t care enough to even open it. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the wrong message at the wrong time for the wrong person. So few people on your list are &ldquo;average&rdquo; that you are essentially targeting no one.</p>

<p>The alternative to this is personalization, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/future-of-email-marketing/">which is taking on a new meaning</a>. Instead of just adding <em>&lt;First.name&gt;</em> to the beginning of every email, start thinking about how you can send one-to-one emails. In other words, how can you send <em>every</em> person on your list the right message at the right time?</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s easier than you think thanks to behavioral email.</strong> By tracking events on your site, you can trigger emails based on interest, context and activity. Instead of blasting the same coupon to all 10,000 people, you can send a positive testimonial about a specific product to people who viewed that product page twice this week. This is the kind of email that has helped grow massive businesses like Amazon, Airbnb, Target and others.

<p>One of the main reasons that social media has become so popular is because it&rsquo;s NOT email. The mechanism of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email is largely the same. The goal is simply to send text and media to people. Now that we have different mediums to accomplish this, it&rsquo;s smart not to put all your eggs in one basket by focusing all of your energy and budget on email.</p>
<p>At Vero, we spend the bulk of our marketing time on content. Email is one of many ways we acquire traffic for that content but Twitter, Facebook, forums, communities and SEO have all been important too. In addition, we separate time spent on newsletters and promotional email with time spent on drip campaigns, onboarding emails, transactional emails and behavioral email.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth looking at where your best customers come from and applying the Pareto principle, also known as the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2014/01/20/pareto-principle-how-to-use-it-to-dramatically-grow-your-business/" target="_blank">80/20 rule</a>. The Pareto principle states that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes. It&rsquo;s been used in business development and personal productivity enhancement for years.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pareto Principle, or &ldquo;80/20 Rule&rdquo; as it is frequently called today, is an incredible tool for growing your business. For instance, if you can figure out which 20% of your time produces 80% of your business&rsquo; results, you can spend more time on those activities and less time on others. Likewise, by identifying the characteristics of the top 20% of your customers (who represent 80% of your sales), you can find more customers like them and dramatically grow your sales and profits.</p></blockquote>
<p>If your best customers come from Twitter, spend more time there. If the best ones come from email, spend more time with email. Whatever you do, leverage multiple platforms and experiment with different content and calls to action to ensure you aren&rsquo;t spending too much time with any single strategy.</p>
<h2>4. Live the Golden Rule.</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Email others as you would have them email you.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>You might think I&rsquo;m being cute &hellip; but I&rsquo;m not. This the the single best way to avoid contributing to global email abuse. If you wouldn&rsquo;t be happy to receive the email you are considering sending, don&rsquo;t send it. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

<html><body><p>An email swipe file is <strong>the best way</strong> to get ideas for your own email marketing. It&rsquo;s a smart idea to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/improve-your-email-marketing-today/">setup folders or labels</a> in your inbox to tag emails that inspire you. That way, you have a constantly growing repository of ideas.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also a good idea to subscribe to lots of newsletters to see what the pros are doing. With all the noise out there, it can be difficult to differentiate between bad email newsletters and great emails newsletters. Every website you visit wants to get you on their subscriber list, and while it&rsquo;s a good to sign up for lots of them, it&rsquo;s nice to have a few newsletters you can always depend on for great ideas.</p>
<p>We pulled together some of the best newsletters on the Internet to help you create a real-time swipe file. Pay close attention, these pros are some of the most savvy marketers on the web.</p>

<li><strong>Tell a story.</strong> He uses storytelling to drive a narrative about life and the meaning of your work. It&rsquo;s a powerful approach that makes his audience <em>feel</em> something.</li>

<p><strong>What you can learn from Joanna&rsquo;s emails:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Show your skills.</strong> No one is better at communicating than Joanna Wiebe. Her writing skills, which she is selling on Copyhackers, really shine through in her emails.</li>
<li><strong>Present solutions.</strong> She is great at explaining a problem and presenting a solution. I often find that I didn&rsquo;t realize I have the problem until she explained it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t chase the lowest common denominator.</strong> Like Noah, her emails have a very personal touch. They feel like they were sent to <em>me</em>, rather than the many thousands of people on her subscriber list.</li>

<h2>Nir Eyal</h2>
<p>Nir Eyal studies and writes about habits. It&rsquo;s no surprise that his email updates are habit-forming. This innovative thinker is putting his research to good use in his own email marketing.</p>

<p><strong>What you can learn from Nir&rsquo;s emails:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Lead with great content.</strong> Nir Eyal <em>leads with content</em>. In fact, he emails entire posts. More importantly, though, his content is <em>so good</em>. Every post explores an interesting topic and is backed with plenty of data and research.</li>

<h2>Gregory Ciotti</h2>
<p>Though infrequent, Gregory Ciotti&rsquo;s newsletter is always a welcome sight in the inbox, thanks to his candid writing and practical advice.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3514" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-swipe-file/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?fit=655%2C472&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="655,472" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gregory-ciotti-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?fit=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?fit=655%2C472&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3514" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png" alt="gregory-ciotti-email-marketing" width="655" height="472" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?resize=139%2C100&amp;ssl=1 139w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gregory-ciotti-email-marketing.png?resize=75%2C54&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></p>
<p><strong>What you can learn from Gregory&rsquo;s emails:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Be transparent.</strong> This is a personal blog and newsletter, and the content is entirely authentic. Most of his work appears on the HelpScout blog so this is a great outlet for in-the-trenches advice. His posts and newsletter often discuss the challenges he and HelpScout face growing their blog and company.</li>
<li><strong>Use real data.</strong> Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know how to get 255,262 views on LinkedIn and 300,000 email subscribers? Gregory uses real data to tell real stories. It&rsquo;s a huge part of what his newsletter so exciting to receive.</li>
<li><strong>Email sparingly.</strong> Because this is a personal endeavor, Gregory doesn&rsquo;t have time to crank out content for the blog and newsletter. When he does, however, it&rsquo;s gold. Don&rsquo;t blast your email subscribers with junk just to get a few pageviews &acirc;&#128;&#148; make sure <em>anything</em> you send is great.</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/" target="_blank">Subscribe here.</a></p>
<p>These four people have created newsletters we can learn from but not everyone is trying to build a personal brand. Here are examples from a few businesses that are really killing it.</p>
<h2>Exposure</h2>
<p>Exposure is a photography portfolio platform that sends out a weekly newsletter featuring the work of their users. It&rsquo;s highly curated and always loaded with beautiful photography.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="619px"><img data-attachment-id="3515" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-swipe-file/exposure-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?fit=619%2C448&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="619,448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="exposure-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?fit=619%2C448&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3515" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png" alt="exposure-email-marketing" width="619" height="448" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?w=619&amp;ssl=1 619w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?resize=138%2C100&amp;ssl=1 138w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/exposure-email-marketing.png?resize=75%2C54&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px"></p>
<p><strong>What you can learn from Exposure&rsquo;s emails:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Embrace imagery.</strong> Art invokes emotion (and makes for beautiful emails). It helps that Exposure has a community of talented photographers uploading new images everyday but any marketer can use visual stimulation to improve their email. Need images? <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/free-image-sources-list" target="_blank">Get some here.</a></li>
<li><strong>Crowdsource.</strong> All of the content in this weekly email is user-generated. If, for example, you work in the SaaS world or e-commerce, look for ways to create your own user-generated content. You could collect case studies, testimonials and even showcase your clients&rsquo; work to help show the value of your own product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Bring in guests.</strong> Another interesting thing about the Exposure newsletter is that they are often curated by guest photographers. It&rsquo;s an even trade &ndash; the guest does the work for your newsletter and then gets some exposure (no pun intended) in the newsletter.</li>

<p>A service like IFTTT can be overwhelming to us non-programmers who don&rsquo;t spend much time creating if-then statements. It&rsquo;s an incredibly powerful service, however, and the use of visual guides throughout their emails and app is enormously helpful.</p>

<p><strong>What you can learn from IFTTT&rsquo;s emails:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Feature other brands.</strong> IFTTT works with lots of other platforms to make their app more powerful. By leveraging the clout of these other businesses, they add credibility to their own.</li>
<li><strong>Deep link.</strong> They often include example &ldquo;Recipes&rdquo; &acirc;&#128;&#148; if-then formulas that connect two apps &acirc;&#128;&#148; in their newsletters. Using deep links, users can enable the Recipes on their own account with a single click.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t get too wordy.</strong> The example email above contains 12 words (not including the text in the sample Recipes). They rely on the images to sell the value of the service.</li>

<h2>Wistia</h2>
<p>Sometimes, less is more. The simplicity of Wistia&rsquo;s emails is refreshing, especially in the crowded marketing space.</p>

<p><strong>What you can learn from Wistia&rsquo;s emails:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Show, don&rsquo;t tell.</strong> An email newsletter isn&rsquo;t a place to convince people to come to your site, it&rsquo;s more of a notification that there&rsquo;s something new. Wistia&rsquo;s straightforward and simple emails simply move subscribers from the inbox to their website without any frills.</li>
<li><strong>Be proactive.</strong> The content in the newsletter above is helping Wistia&rsquo;s users future-proof their SEO. It&rsquo;s not only helpful information but the kind of gesture that endears users to the source.</li>
<li><strong>Get specific.</strong> In the marketing community, think pieces aren&rsquo;t going to do much for your conversions but niche content can really move the needle. &ldquo;Video in a post-snippet world&rdquo; is very specific and highly valuable to the right audience.</li>

<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s time we welcome a new era of email marketing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bulk&rdquo; email is gone and it&rsquo;s not coming back. Our technology is too good for it and our attention spans are too short for it. With all the noise out there, your emails have to seriously rock to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>Luckily, every marketer has access to the tools they need to take email to the next level. What&rsquo;s often needed is simply a change in perspective.</p>
<p><span id="more-3479"></span></p>
<h2>The Mindset for Email Marketing Success</h2>
<p>The old email marketing mindset looked something like this:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="400px"><img data-attachment-id="3492" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-marketing-2-0/old-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="old-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3492" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg" alt="old-email-marketing" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/old-email-marketing.jpg?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Bulk email is as effective as the junk mail you throw away before even opening. Since it&rsquo;s not personalized or data-driven, it&rsquo;s a race to the bottom. It&rsquo;s expensive and highly ineffective. There is a better way!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s your new <strong>email marketing 2.0</strong> mantra:</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t market to the the lowest common denominator. Use data and personalization to reach the right people at the right time.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>With this new guiding principle burned into your mind, you can begin to examine exactly how to approach your content, copywriting, subject lines, campaigns, segments and calls to action.</p>
<h2>An Introduction to Big Data for Email Marketers</h2>
<p>The key to email marketing 2.0 is data. It didn&rsquo;t used to be accessible and easy to use, which is exactly how your inbox got flooded with all that junk. Marketers just guessed. Times have changed, though, and now every marketer has access to tools that can make data easy to collect, analyze and act on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, that you run an e-commerce business. You have a database of customers and their purchases. You have another database that you use for your email newsletter where you send occasional updates about your product or company. Besides that, you have some Twitter followers, a Facebook fan page and an active blog.</p>
<p>Many of the same people interact with you on these different channels but because the databases can&rsquo;t communicate with each other, you have no idea what <em>exactly</em> is driving your sales. If someone clicks a link in your newsletter to a blog post, then views a product page but doesn&rsquo;t actually make a purchase until two days later when they click a link in a tweet, <strong>you can&rsquo;t track it</strong>.</p>
<h2>A New Mindset = Better Email and More Sales</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s approach this scenario from the email marketing 2.0 angle. Here&rsquo;s how the situation might be different.</p>
<p>You write a blog post and schedule an email for your subscribers. Some of these people have already made purchases while most have not. You segment the list and send it to your customers first. They get early access to your content, which makes them feel good and gives you feedback so you can tweak the content before sending it to the list of non-customers (which is much larger). Non-customers get an email with a link to the same post.</p>
<p>Once the email is sent, visitors start showing up to read your post. On the blog, you are A/B testing two calls to action. One asks visitors to download an e-book while the other suggests more content they might like (and that you <em>know</em> converts).</p>
<p>Throughout the blog, you mention and link to products. As visitors check out these products, you are tracking events in your database. For customers who are logged in, you know exactly which products they are looking at and how they got there. When a customer views the same product page twice in one week, you have an email that automatically triggers showing them a testimonial about the product and offering 5% off if they buy within 24 hours.</p>
<p>For the rest, you are tracking them with cookies and gathering data which you can later attribute to a customer profile once they make a purchase. Using a re-marketing tool like <a href="http://www.perfectaudience.com/">PerfectAudience</a>, you can show them ads for the products they&rsquo;ve viewed on your site when they head off to Facebook, Twitter and other sites.</p>
<p>With each new blog post and email, you collect more and more data that shapes the way you construct your landing pages, product pages, what content you write and how often you email them. No email is ever a &ldquo;blast&rdquo;. Each has a purpose that can be tracked and improved on.</p>

<h2>All In: How to Get Started with Email Marketing 2.0</h2>
<p>In a matter of minutes, you can get the tools you need to make this kind of marketing a reality. While we obviously recommend Vero, there are a few other platforms with this capability that you can check out. Whichever platform you choose, here are some tips to get you started.</p>
<h3>The Obvious Tips</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Add more value than ever.</strong> Moreso than ever, value is the name of the game. When I look around at some of the best emails I get, they deliver massive value. Take HelpScout for example. Their content is <em>so good</em> that it would never cross my mind to delete one of their emails. That weekly newsletter is my gateway to learning something profound about customer support. A reputation like that isn&rsquo;t earned overnight but their hard week has payed off big time. Their newsletter now boasts more than 50,000 subscribers.Whether the newsletter itself or the content it links to is great, make sure the people on your email list can&rsquo;t get enough.</li>
<li><strong>Go mobile.</strong> I know, everyone is sick of hearing this one. It&rsquo;s so obvious. Still, 48 percent of emails are opened on a mobile device and just 11 percent of marketing emails are optimized for mobile (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">source plus more stats</a>). There&rsquo;s a huge disconnect in the way marketers <em>talk</em> about mobile and <em>execute</em> on a mobile strategy. Spend the time to either design a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/html-email-templates/">mobile responsive HTML email template</a> or buy a great template. In a pinch, you can always send a plain text email too.</li>
<li><strong>Take it one step at a time.</strong> You aren&rsquo;t going to be able to implement a data-driven, personalized email strategy in one day. Start by importing your contacts and segmenting them as much as you can. A really good campaign moves people dynamically from one campaign to another based on their behavior so spend time outlining your customer lifecycle and matching the appropriate emails with the right people and time.</li>
</ul><h3>The Not-So Obvious Tips</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Take personalization to the next level.</strong> Including someone&rsquo;s first name in an email is a great start but as you collect more data, personalization can be so much more powerful. Event tracking is where personalization gets really interesting. When you track events, like a SaaS user failing to login for two weeks, you can automatically trigger emails based on the size of their business, annual revenue, number of employees and past usage history. For most marketers, this would take the place of no communication at all, so it&rsquo;s nearly guaranteed to drive more sales and user engagement.</li>
<li class=" small-image" style="px"><strong>Perform an email audit.</strong> Here is a classic email marketing problem. A company sends promotional emails that few people open and read but sends transactional emails &acirc;&#128;&#148; receipts, notifications, welcome notes, etc. &acirc;&#128;&#148; that lots of people read and open. The issue is that transactional emails are opened at up to 8x the rate of promotional emails yet they have little to no marketing value.The key is finding the sweet spot. An email that people need and actually want to open but that also moves them closer to a sales goal.<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/making_email_better_sweet_spot1.png" alt="Triggered email sweet spot">Your transactional emails are likely sent by a third party, so they accomplish a function but do nothing for your marketing efforts. Find every email that your customers could possibly receive from you or on your behalf and start optimizing them. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/transactional-email/">You can read A LOT more on transactional email here.</a></li>
<li><strong>A/B test like your life depends on it.</strong> Take advantage of every opportunity to run an A/B test. This holds true for emails, where you can test subject lines, &ldquo;from&rdquo; addresses, body copy, calls to action, plain text vs. HTML, time of day, day of the week and a number of other factors. You can also A/B test:
<ul><li>article headlines with <a href="http://kingsumo.com/apps/headlines/?hvid=2r28g8" target="_blank">KingSumo Headlines</a></li>
<li>landing pages with <a href="http://unbounce.com/" target="_blank">Unbounce</a> and <a href="http://www.leadpages.net/" target="_blank">LeadPages</a></li>
<li>your entire website with <a href="https://vwo.com/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Above all, the key to killing it with email is to <strong>think big</strong>. What&rsquo;s your next move? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<html><body><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if your subscribers were hooked on your emails? If they opened and read your emails without thinking about it? What would that do for your open and click-through rates? And what would that do to your bottom line?</p>
<p>Yes, it would it be wonderful and according to Nir Eyal, author of <a href="http://www.hookmodel.com/">Hooked: How To Build Habit-Forming Products</a>, it&rsquo;s totally possible. <strong>The key, Eyal says, is to develop in your subscribers the habit of consuming your emails.</strong></p>
<p>Eyal defines a habit as &ldquo;things we do with little or no conscious thought.&rdquo; And he describes a four-phase process for developing a habit around your product, which in this case would be your marketing emails. Interestingly enough, <strong>Eyal calls email &ldquo;the mother of all habit-forming technology.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Checking emails has become a habit we do several times a day. Some people do it within a few minutes of waking up in the morning, before they even get out of bed. Think about your own relationship with email. Are there marketing emails you actually look forward to receiving? Are there particular people or companies whose emails you read &mdash; no matter what the subject line?</p>
<p>If so, then you&rsquo;ve probably made a habit of reading their emails.</p>
<p>Below, we&rsquo;ll look at why emails are habit-forming, and how you can get your subscribers hooked on your emails.</p>
<p><span id="more-3399"></span></p>
<h2>The 4 Phases of Emails That &ldquo;Hook&rdquo; Readers</h2>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="338" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FDtycnZgCfY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>1. Trigger</h3>
<p>The habit-creation process begins with a trigger. This is anything that sets a behavior in motion. Triggers can be external, such as a new email notification banner or ping.</p>
<p>The trigger could be internal, like feeling bored or wanting to feel important by seeing a long list of new emails in your inbox.</p>
<p>Emails provide both external and internal triggers. Seeing your name and email subject line in your subscriber&rsquo;s inbox are external triggers. Your subscriber&rsquo;s motivations for reading your emails &acirc;&#128;&#148; whether it&rsquo;s boredom, curiosity, or some other driver &acirc;&#128;&#148; are internal triggers. <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/04/billion-dollar-mind-trick.html" target="_blank">Eyal explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a product is able to become tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a pre-existing habit, it creates an &acirc;&#128;&#156;internal trigger.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Unlike external triggers, which are sensory stimuli, like a phone ringing or an ad online telling us to &acirc;&#128;&#156;click here now!,&acirc;&#128;&#157; you can&rsquo;t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. Internal triggers manifest automatically in the mind and creating them is the brass ring of consumer technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your job is to discover what motivates your subscribers to read your emails. What are their internal triggers? Use those purposefully to write even <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/winning-email-subject-lines-and-examples/">more effective subject lines</a> (external trigger) that connect with your readers&rsquo; internal triggers as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Action</h3>
<p>The second phase of habit creation is &ldquo;action,&rdquo; or carrying out a specific behavior in expectation of a reward.</p>
<p>In the case of email marketing, you want your subscribers to perform a series of actions: open your email, read or scan through it, and click on a link. Maybe you want them to forward the email to friends as well.</p>
<p><strong>Consuming your emails will become a habit only if subscribers expect and get rewarded after performing each of these actions.</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3408" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/the-hooked-model/hooked-model-60-638/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?fit=638%2C493&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="638,493" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hooked-model-action" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?fit=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?fit=638%2C493&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3408" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg" alt="hooked-model-action" width="638" height="493" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?w=638&amp;ssl=1 638w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=129%2C100&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=75%2C58&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px"></p>
<p>So the next phase in creating a habit is&hellip;</p>
<h3>3. Variable Reward</h3>
<p>Eyal identifies three types of rewards: rewards of the tribe, the hunt, and the self.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the tribe</em> are those that make us &ldquo;feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One way to give subscribers rewards of the tribe is to give them a special name. This makes them feel like they&rsquo;re part of an exclusive club. They&rsquo;ll look forward to your emails and read them almost without thinking, because they&rsquo;re reminders that they belong somewhere.</p>
<p>Another reward of the tribe is to connect subscribers with different people in your company. For example, if your emails are always signed by your marketing director, why not send one from the CEO? Or another from an employee who has some interesting and useful content for your readers?</p>
<p>Behind-the-scenes access to your business and receiving information ahead of the general public are other examples of rewards of the tribe.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the hunt</em> are goods, products, services, information, or other resources we need to survive or to get through our daily lives.</p>
<p>Examples of rewards of the hunt are subscriber-only giveaways. For example, ship some cool swag to the first 50 subscribers who click on your link or reply to your email with their snail mail address.</p>
<p>Or occasionally give your subscribers ebooks, webinars, checklists, recordings, and other useful stuff for free. Make sure only subscribers have this privilege.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the self</em> are feelings of competency, mastery, achievement, and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Subscribers get a reward of the self when they&rsquo;re able to empty their email inbox. Or are able to respond to every email that requires it.</p>
<p>You can reward subscribers with the same sense of accomplishment by grouping a series of emails into an e-course, for example. Then as you finish sending the series, tell your readers they&rsquo;ve just completed the e-course.</p>
<p>Take note this step is called <em>variable</em> rewards. If the rewards become predictable, they&rsquo;ll be less effective at creating habits. So change things up a bit. Give your readers something unexpected every so often.</p>
<p><strong>4. Investment</strong></p>
<p>The final phase in habit creation is investment. This refers to your subscribers investing something of themselves into your emails. According to Eyal, investments can take the form of time, data, effort, social capital, or money.</p>
<p>Investment is important in habit creation, because it gives subscribers a sense of ownership. The harder they work to consume your emails, the more they will value them.</p>
<p>Emails naturally require investment from your subscribers. In the first place, it requires effort for them to sign up for your emails and confirm their subscription (if you use double opt in). Then they need to invest time to actually read the emails.</p>
<p>But you could gradually ask for even more from your subscribers &mdash; <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve given them something valuable first, such as a series of really useful emails. Charging a subscription fee for an exclusive monthly newsletter or forum is one example. Another is requiring them to share a link on their Facebook or Twitter account to unlock additional content. Asking them to complete a brief survey is another type of investment.</p>
<p><strong>In other words, ask your subscribers to expend some effort in your emails. They will value your emails more as a result.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that these investments should initiate new triggers. For instance, subscribers who share your link in Facebook could then automatically receive a set of autoresponder emails relevant to them. Same thing with those who paid for your newsletter or responded to your survey.</p>
<p>Every action your subscribers take helps you deliver more targeted, more relevant content to them. This makes your emails more rewarding, which then increases the likelihood that your subscribers will get hooked on them.</p>
<p>By the way, Vero makes it easy for you to deliver content based on actions your subscribers make.</p>
<p>Carry out these four phases often enough, and you will create among your subscribers the habit of consuming your emails.</p>
<h2>Hooked: Not Just For Tech Products</h2>
<p>Eyal wrote &ldquo;Hooked&rdquo; to describe how using technology-based products, such as apps and social networks, become habits for users.</p>
<p>You can learn more from Eyal&rsquo;s slideshow below:</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="597" height="486" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/16424773" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>

<p>I hope you now see that the Hook model is applicable to your email marketing as well. Many people are already addicted to checking their emails to begin with. Study the Hook Model and apply it to your email marketing. Help your subscribers develop the habit of consuming your emails, clicking on your links, and spreading the word about your content.</p>
<p>Knowing what you know now, what are you going to do to get your subscribers hooked on your emails?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>There are many misconceptions about marketing, especially when it comes to email.</p>
<p>In our fast-paced world, email is a nearly-ancient technology. Interestingly enough, it&rsquo;s still widely-used and gaining more users every year. To clear up any confusion, here are three misconceptions about email marketing that simply aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p><span id="more-3343"></span></p>
<h2>1. &ldquo;Email is dying.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Since the first email was sent by Ray Tomlinson in 1971, email usage has grown steadily. For more than 40 years, email users and businesses have relied on email to communicate and share documents. Even in recent years when technology has saturated much of the world, email usage continues to grow.</p>
<p>In 2013, there were 2.4 billion email users in the world. By 2017, <a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Email-Market-2013-2017-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Radicati</a> projects that number will increase by 300 million to 2.7 billion total email users.</p>
<p>The number of emails that people send is also on the rise. In 2013, users sent 182 billion per day. That number is expected to climb to 207 billion, a 14 percent increase.</p>
<p><script id="infogram_0_infographic-01196" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
<div style="width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;"><a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<p>Not impressed? Here are few other facts to prove that email isn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>
<ul><li>91 percent of consumers check their email at least daily. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/"><em>Source</em></a></li>
<li>Email is the #1 preferred method of communication in offices. <a href="http://qz.com/97473/what-research-tells-us-about-getting-better-at-email/" target="_blank"><em>Source</em></a></li>
<li>60 percent of executives read email newsletters as their primary news source. <a href="http://insights.qz.com/ges/" target="_blank"><em>Source</em></a></li>
</ul><h2>2. &ldquo;Millennials don&rsquo;t use email.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Millennials &acirc;&#128;&#148; roughly defined as people born between the 1980s and early 2000s who are avid users of technology &acirc;&#128;&#148; communicate on a wide variety of platforms. While apps like Snapchat and Instagram have driven the huge surge in mobile usage, email remains as important as ever for this generation.</p>
<p>A study from <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change.pdf" target="_blank">Pew Internet</a> puts Millennials and tech use in perspective. Here are a few highlights from the study relating to tech and email usage.</p>
<p><strong>56 percent of Millennials have sent an email in the last 24 hours.</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/16863?token=hx_VcNyWwXtGnjPz8ZR5BcjQsySuysaaSDPNWsktNZYd64fnLOGdhjvfztgjvMxReaeyWO9Oe-jJQc7eFvg7mPo" alt="millennials-email-usage-1" width="640" height="388"></p>
<p><strong>Internet and email usage continue to rise.</strong></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="387px"><img class="alignnone" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/16865?token=Gf1enzFzZDdq2mShcDtTDruedZF4qqgSSjKYQDYwDeJzfWVd_u2NNRsYrwxemQmv9u0XfZduzEXa8KEbSFqDuUA" alt="email-usage-millennials-2" width="387" height="398"></p>

<p><strong>83 percent of Millennials sleep next to their phone.</strong></p>

<p>While messaging apps and social media certainly influence the way Millennials communicate, email usage is still increasing for this tech-savvy generation.</p>
<h2>3. &ldquo;Social and mobile are killing email.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not often that email marketing is written up in the <em>New York Times</em> but it happened just last week. David Carr, the media columnist for the <em>Times</em>, wrote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html?_r=0">compelling piece</a> explaining why email is experiencing a renaissance, despite increased competition from social media sites and messaging apps. In fact, Carr argues, the value of useful email newsletters increases as the competition gets noisier.</p>
<p>Here are a few excerpts from the article.</p>
<blockquote><p>Email newsletters, an old-school artifact of the web that was supposed to die along with dial-up connections, are not only still around, but very much on the march.</p>
<p>Newsletters are clicking because readers have grown tired of the endless stream of information on the Internet, and having something finite and recognizable show up in your inbox can impose order on all that chaos.</p>
<p>At a time when lots of news and information is whizzing by online, email newsletters &acirc;&#128;&#148; some free, some not &acirc;&#128;&#148; help us figure out what&rsquo;s worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>An email newsletter generally shows up in your inbox because you asked for it and it includes links to content you have deemed relevant. In other words, it&rsquo;s important content you want in list form, which seems like a suddenly modern approach.</p>
<p>It helps that email, long dismissed as a festering petri dish of marketing come-ons, has cleaned up its act. Gmail, in particular, has stamped out a lot of spam and segmented the inbox into personal, social and promotional streams that make email much less a mess than it used to be.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>Is your email marketing stale?</p>
<p>You know what I mean. You send the same weekly or monthly update to the same people. You don&rsquo;t put much thought into subject lines. You barely even check your open and click rates, let alone spend time trying to improve them.</p>
<p><strong>You aren&rsquo;t alone.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not unusual for marketers to get in an email marketing rut given everything on their plates. For this exact reason, we created a list of ways to jumpstart your email efforts.</p>
<p><strong>These are things you can do today.</strong></p>
<p>What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><span id="more-3268"></span></p>
<h2>1. Create an inbox swipe file.</h2>
<p>This is the first and most important thing you can do to improve your own email marketing. First, setup a label (in Gmail) or folder in your inbox and title it &ldquo;Swipe File.&rdquo; Anytime you see a great subject line, a good offer, a beautiful design or great copy, just add the message to your swipe file. Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll have a repository of inspiration that you can tap into when you are working on your own campaigns.</p>
<p>To make this even more powerful, set up individual labels or folders depending on why the email caught your attention. Example: Create a folder for &ldquo;Great Subject Lines&rdquo; so you&rsquo;ll always remember why you set aside the email for later. Add a few emails each day and, soon, you&rsquo;ll have hundreds of ideas for writing better emails.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how my swipe file looks:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="169px"><img data-attachment-id="3269" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/improve-your-email-marketing-today/swipe-file-example/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?fit=169%2C179&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="169,179" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="swipe file example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?fit=169%2C179&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?fit=169%2C179&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3269" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png" alt="swipe file example" width="169" height="179" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?w=169&amp;ssl=1 169w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?resize=94%2C100&amp;ssl=1 94w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?resize=47%2C50&amp;ssl=1 47w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png?resize=71%2C75&amp;ssl=1 71w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px"></p>
<p>One other easy way to use your own inbox to inspire you is to track your competitors. You can do this by setting up filters to automatically organize the messages and use <a href="http://www.seerinteractive.com/blog/ifttt-recipes-for-marketers#comp1" target="_blank">IFTTT to archive them</a> in Evernote for analysis.</p>
<h2>2. Find every customer touch point.</h2>
<p>Your customers and leads could be receiving emails about you and from you <em>that you didn&rsquo;t send</em>. How is that possible?</p>
<p>Many businesses use third parties to send <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hack-transactional-emails/">transactional email</a>. It makes sending webinar confirmations and monthly invoices super easy but it can also be a missed marketing opportunity or, worse, a negative representation of your brand.</p>
<p>Check out this very common webinar confirmation email. It&rsquo;s from Copyblogger but it&rsquo;s <em>really</em> from Citrix. It uses a Citrix email address and even links to the Citrix website!</p>

<p>Avoid this at all costs. Even though it gets the required job done, it&rsquo;s a few seconds of your audience&rsquo;s attention that you can never get back.</p>
<h2>3. Send an A/B test.</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be too tech-savvy to send really smart A/B tests. If data-driven marketing intimidates you, <strong>start small</strong>.</p>
<p>A simple subject line split test will give you really valuable data for your next email, assuming you are testing the right things. In order to learn something, you have to be willing to go out on a limb. You have to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/say-goodbye-to-comfortable/">step outside your comfort zone</a>.</p>
<p>Once, I A/B tested these two subject lines:</p>
<ul><li>5 Reasons Why Email Marketing Fails</li>
<li>Why Email Marketing Fails</li>
</ul><p>What did I learn? Next to nothing.</p>
<p>The next time I ran a subject line A/B test, I tried two very different approaches to the subject line.</p>
<ul><li>Content isn&rsquo;t the only way&hellip;</li>
<li>Learn from the pros: How to build an awesome community</li>
</ul><p>&ldquo;Content isn&rsquo;t the only way&hellip;&rdquo; generated five percent more opens. Now I know that short subject lines resonate with our readers and I can apply that knowledge to my next test.</p>
<p>One other simple A/B test you can try is plain text emails vs. HTML emails. Keep the subject line the same so you can measure the clicks without skewing data from the open rate. Depending on the type of email &acirc;&#128;&#148; promotional, transactional or behavioural &acirc;&#128;&#148; you will have varying degrees of success with plain text or HTML. Every audience is different and it&rsquo;s worth testing to learn more about them.</p>

<h2>4. Learn to write better copy.</h2>
<p>Your <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/say-goodbye-to-comfortable/">marketing is a performance</a> so why aren&rsquo;t you training to improve?</p>
<p>All marketing centers around effective communication. Whether you are crafting your next email campaign, writing content for your blog or drafting 140-character masterpieces, communication, and specifically writing, is at the core of it all. Here are a few resources to improve your writing:</p>
<ul><li>Copyblogger: <a href="http://my.copyblogger.com/basic/copywriting-101-ebook/" target="_blank">How to Craft Compelling Copy</a> and <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/category/radio/" target="_blank">The Lede podcast</a></li>
<li>Joanna Wiebe&rsquo;s <a href="http://copyhackers.com/web-copywriting-books/" target="_blank">copywriting e-books</a> and <a href="http://copywritingcourse.copyhackers.com/" target="_blank">course</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl" target="_blank">Grammar Girl</a></li>
</ul><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Cute. RT <a href="https://twitter.com/UTWRWP">@UTWRWP</a> The Subjunctive Form in English <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/grammar?src=hash">#grammar</a> <a href="http://t.co/NX3bjxWO7l">pic.twitter.com/NX3bjxWO7l</a></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Mignon Fogarty (@GrammarGirl) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrammarGirl/statuses/479080466725613568">June 18, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And here are a few writing tips that I swear by:</p>
<ul><li>Use sub-headers and bullet points to break up content.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t force it. Take breaks, drink coffee and listen to relaxing music.</li>
<li>Use different tools for writing. I go back and forth between <a href="https://draftin.com/" target="_blank">Draft</a>, <a href="http://mouapp.com/" target="_blank">Mou</a>, <a href="http://writer.pro/" target="_blank">iA Writer</a>, Google Docs and Pages. I also use <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> to keep track of ideas and write outlines.</li>
<li>Write every day, even if it&rsquo;s stream of consciousness or just crazy ideas.</li>
</ul><p>However you choose to do it, spend time perfecting your craft.</p>
<h2>5. Segment your lists.</h2>
<p>The people on your email list haven&rsquo;t all ended up there in the same way. Some subscribed to a newsletter while others are past customers. And they don&rsquo;t all have the same needs, even if they have shown interest in your product or service at some point. It&rsquo;s time to stop treating them all the same way. Segmenting your email lists can start with basic groups and eventually evolve to <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features" target="_blank">dynamic lists</a> that change based on user behavior.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to get started segmenting your list so you can send better, more targeted emails:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Tag your best customers and keep them separate.</strong> These people buy often and aren&rsquo;t afraid to spend money. You want to make sure they aren&rsquo;t getting generic emails. Once they are segmented, send them emails that make them feel specials. No 10% coupons for these folks &hellip; they want value, not deals.</li>
<li><strong>Separate anyone who has never spent a dime on your product.</strong> These folks are leads, not customers, and should be treated accordingly. They need informative emails with strong calls to action and a value proposition that will keep their attention.</li>
<li><strong>Identify &ldquo;cold&rdquo; users and warm them up.</strong> Look for people who haven&rsquo;t opened an email in the last six months and put them on a separate list. Whatever you are doing isn&rsquo;t working, so try something new. One idea is to load their email addresses into <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/twitter-lead-generation-cards/">Twitter Ads</a> and starting showing them targeted ads before starting a new warm-up campaign.</li>
</ul><h2>6. Upgrade your toolbox.</h2>
<p>This section is re-purposed from our big post of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/54-email-marketing-resources/">54 Essential Email Marketing Resources</a> but it&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to upgrade your marketing fast.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>This is a potentially endless category, so we intentionally kept this list short. Here are some of the best and most useful email marketing tools out there.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en" target="_blank">Google URL Builder</a>: This is the easiest way to keep track of clicks from email campaigns in Google Analytics. This tool makes it easy to set parameters, which can easily be tracked. CrazyEgg has a <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/08/29/google-url-builder-for-email-links/" target="_blank">really useful tutorial</a> on the topic. <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Buffer uses this feature, and you can customize the tracking in your settings, under &acirc;&#128;&#156;Link Shortening.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>: For those rare occasions when you need to send an attachment &acirc;&#128;&#148; an e-book download, a receipt, etc. &acirc;&#128;&#148; use Dropbox to send a link rather than a file. Your recipients&rsquo; inboxes will appreciate it.</li>
<li><a href="https://litmus.com/email-testing" target="_blank">Litmus</a>: This is an awesome way to see how your email will look in 30 different email clients. It&rsquo;s a cool way to ensure your emails are mobile-ready. Litmus also offers advanced tracking and spam-filter testing.</li>
<li><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>: Think IFTTT on steroids. Zapier allows you to connect web apps to each other via a simple interface. KISSmetrics <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-increase-webinar-sign-up-rates/" target="_blank">famously used Zapier</a> to supercharge webinar registrations by 1,000 percent! Because you can connect a number of enterprise applications &acirc;&#128;&#148; Unbounce, GoToMeeting, Github, Salesforce, Freshbooks, Help Scout and many more &acirc;&#128;&#148; it&rsquo;s possible to automate all kinds of tasks, including data collection.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/118708?hl=en" target="_blank">Gmail Labels</a>: It&rsquo;s simple, yes, but Gmail Labels are the perfect way to create an email swipe file. When you see an email you like and want to borrow ideas from, simply drag it into your swipe file. Pretty soon, you will have a treasure trove of ideas for subject lines, email copy and growth hacks.</li>
