<html><body><p>With the redesign of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com" target="_blank">our homepage</a> and the release of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion" target="_blank">Fusion</a> today, we&rsquo;re re-affirming our vision here at Vero to help Product Teams use customer data to create best-in-class email interactions.</p>
<p>Over the coming few months you should see some important updates from us on this blog regarding methodology, product updates and new releases. I invite you to keep up to date with our blog and follow our <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/release-notes" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>, which will be updated every few weeks.</p>
<hr><p>Vero was founded in 2012 and, initially, our focus was on helping marketers use real time customer activity to power automated email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>To begin, we developed a software solution that centred on an API to collect your customer activity via a real time event stream and a UI to create automated email campaigns.</p>
<p>The promise was that simple but powerful API libraries would provide marketing with a rich data stream <strong>without</strong> any real engineering interaction and that Vero&rsquo;s software would enable them to visually create and manage email content, user segments and automated workflows.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the intervening four years. Critically, we&rsquo;ve observed that the organizations who see the <strong>best</strong> results have Product, Engineering and Marketing Teams that <strong>collaborate</strong> to develop high-quality emails. In other words, the <strong>entire</strong> organization is invested in their customers&rsquo; experience of their products. These teams work together closely to ensure that data in and emails out are both accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>For these customers, Vero provides a platform for several or more employees from different teams to <strong>work together</strong> to deploy high quality email experiences: experiences that are heavily data-driven and personalised.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, we want to highlight that Vero is the platform that enables Product, Engineering and Marketing teams to collaborate on product experiences. What we have built today is just the beginning of what we want to build to help teams achieve their goal of providing customers with consistent, personal and valuable experiences of their product(s).</p>
<p>This direction is informed by our vision for Vero: to enable organizations to use their data to deliver products with more utility.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://veropublic.wpengine.com">new homepage</a> brings clarity to this vision and summarises the approach forward-thinking teams are taking to building high quality email experiences &ndash; the approach used by Vero&rsquo;s best customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just getting started. In order to achieve our vision we need to continue to build out tools that help customers achieve:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Data accuracy </strong>&ndash; ensuring complete and accurate data is available for personalisation and modelling, as organizations invest too much time synchronizing and managing the accuracy of their data.</li>
<li><strong>Highly available user models </strong>&ndash; in order to create personalized, valuable product experiences, you have to have data about your customers at the ready, whether they are interacting on-site, in a mobile application or via an email or message.</li>
<li><strong>Efficacious customer interactions, at scale</strong> &ndash; companies are collecting more data and reaching more users than ever before. Ensuring customers have the right experience with accurate data at scale requires a well-defined collaboration and deployment process.</li>
</ul><p>Vero already helps organizations deploy hundreds of millions of valuable email interactions every month and we look forward to working together as we build out the tooling and methodology to help you maintain data accuracy, model your customers and ensure your customer interactions are reliable every time, regardless of your scale.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried Vero before, or if haven&rsquo;t visited it in some time, I invite you to <a href="https://app.getvero.com/signup">create an account</a> and learn more about how we&rsquo;re helping teams collaborate more effectively to deploy more valuable email experiences.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking ahead to a fantastic next 12 months &ndash; and can&rsquo;t wait to share updates with you along the way.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p class="lead">A customer-centric approach to product, marketing and support is the key to building a great company.</p>
<p>As anyone who&rsquo;s ever built a SaaS business can attest, it&rsquo;s easier said than done. We always aim to help customers find their way and this, ultimately, served as the foundation for our decision to build our own help documentation.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a perfect example of how that approach manifests itself in a busy, growing company.</p>
<p>Last week, we launched new a help documentation site, <a href="http://help.getvero.com/">help.getvero.com</a>, to make it easy for customers to get started, use our API and answer technical questions about Vero. The new help docs are faster, more robust and just plain more helpful than our previous docs.</p>
<p>To power the new setup, we are using <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://algolia.com" target="_blank">Algolia</a> as well as our own <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> deployment to host our CSS on the AWS CloudFront CDN. The infrastructure is better, the design is cleaner and the content is more useful. The end result is a focused site that meets the needs of our customers. Additionally, anyone can suggest changes, whether they be internal Vero team members (both engineers and non-engineers), customers or otherwise.</p>
<p>This post explores the reasons we chose to build our own help docs, the challenges we ran into, and how we stay focused on a customer-centric solution. Everything is open-source, so anyone can use this setup as a viable alternative to the various hosted SaaS help doc options.</p>
<blockquote class="snippet"><p>As mentioned above, we have published our new help documentation as a <a href="https://github.com/getvero/getvero.github.io" target="_blank"><em>public repository on Github</em></a><em> that <strong>anyone</strong> can </em><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" target="_blank"><em>fork</em></a><em> and edit to create their own help documentation (you can also create pull requests for updates to our own help articles). </em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Why we rebuilt our help documentation</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7272" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/saas-help-docs/vero-help-docs/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-help-docs.png?fit=950%2C570&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="950,570" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero-help-docs" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-help-docs.png?fit=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-help-docs.png?fit=950%2C570&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7272" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-help-docs.png" alt="vero-help-docs" width="950" height="570" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-help-docs.png?w=950&amp;ssl=1 950w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-help-docs.png?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px"></p>
<p>We previously hosted our help articles on WordPress. Using a custom post type, docs were hosted on the same installation as our marketing website. WordPress was easy for our entire team, including the less-technical among us, to use and all us of pitched in.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this created some real challenges.</p>
<p>Using custom post types buried our help documentation inside WordPress, making it hard to find and update old articles. Our engineers weren&rsquo;t invested in the infrastructure, making it too easy to put off updating the docs when we launched new features. Worse yet, we&rsquo;d never spent the time to draft a style guide, so help articles were inconsistent and repetitive.</p>
<h2>The decision to build, not buy</h2>
<p>When we committed to fixing our help doc problem, the team evaluated a number of off-the-shelf solutions, including HelpJuice, Help Scout&rsquo;s Docs, Zendesk&rsquo;s Knowledge Base and a few other great products.</p>
<p>We use Help Scout for our email support (absolutely love it) and have previously used HelpJuice. Each is a great solution, but we couldn&rsquo;t find a product that met our four key needs, which directly support our customers&rsquo; needs:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>We wanted search to be super-fast. Slow search is almost as bad as no search. <em>We know from testing that it&rsquo;s how most customers find the help they need.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wanted to be able to feature our <a href="http://status.getvero.com" target="_blank">status page updates</a>, hosted on <a href="http://statuspage.io" target="_blank">StatusPage.io</a> as part of our design. <em>Uptime is a feature and we want customers to know when we run into challenges that affect them.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wanted to build a foundation that will allow for future customization. <em>Support videos are the next thing to add but who knows that the future of support holds. We want to be ready to adapt quickly.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wanted to be able to manage our own categories and navigation. <em>We already know where customers run into trouble so crafting sensible navigation can guide them to quick answers.</em></p>
</li>
</ol><p>When none of the aforementioned tools met these requirements in the way we really wanted, we began discussing the idea of building out our platform. The idea seemed crazy at first. After all, why reinvent the wheel? It would mean managing a CMS, worrying about deploys, setting up local environments, and worst of all, potentially wasting a lot of time.</p>
<p>We all baulked at a homegrown solution but did some research to confirm our suspicions. What we found, however, was that using Jekyll, <a href="https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-jekyll" target="_blank">Algolia&rsquo;s Search for Jekyll Plugin</a>, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, we could actually run custom help articles with no deployment scripts, blazing fast search and a completely custom user interface.</p>
<h2>Find a solution that works for engineers and non-techies.</h2>
<p>Everyone on the team contributes to support, so everyone should be able to create and edit articles. Github&rsquo;s Desktop tool makes it easy to update and deploy help articles, but it&rsquo;s a new world for our less-technical team members. This is a real concern as getting developers engaged but losing the rest of the team wouldn&rsquo;t solve our problem.</p>
<p>Interestingly, less-technical team members embraced the solution. It&rsquo;s a good excuse to learn a bit of code and it brought different areas of the company together. We set a hard deadline to complete our docs and everyone contributed to the launch. There&rsquo;s nothing like a due date to kick off a new process.</p>
<p>The key to this has been managing this process in three ways.</p>
<ol><li>
<p><strong>Using GitHub Desktop.</strong> It&rsquo;s a lightweight tool that makes it easy for anyone to contribute code to a repository. Thanks to the magic of GitHub Pages, every deploy and push (or sync) to the <code>master</code> branch of our help repository means the code is automatically deployed. This is a huge win because it makes it easy for anyone on our team to get a local copy of the help articles on their computer, so they can edit them with their favourite Markdown editor. That means we can use the best tools for the each job &ndash; rather than the less-than-ideal online text editor offered by WordPress, team members can use their own editors. Rather than using WordPress&rsquo; limited functionality, we can build our own with Jekyll. Win-win.<img data-attachment-id="7275" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/saas-help-docs/github-desktop-3/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png?fit=1141%2C619&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1141,619" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="github-desktop" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png?fit=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png?fit=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7275" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png" alt="github-desktop" width="1141" height="619" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png?w=1141&amp;ssl=1 1141w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/github-desktop2.png?resize=1024%2C556&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li>
<p><strong>Teaching our less-technical members about </strong><a href="http://blog.ghost.org/markdown/" target="_blank"><strong>Markdown</strong></a> and simple tools like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Tex</a>t or <a href="http://writeapp.net/" target="_blank">Write</a>. Both applications let you open a folder of Markdown files for editing. These tools are built for editing Markdown, making them a gateway into the world of coding. We&rsquo;ve found that our less-technical team members have really embraced them.</p>
</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li>
<p><strong> Writing a </strong><a href="https://github.com/getvero/getvero.github.io#testing-locally" target="_blank"><strong>comprehensive README</strong></a> that explains, in detail, how to setup and manage the help docs repository locally. It&rsquo;s help docs for our help docs.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>To illustrate what we mean, we have found that all team members have been sticking to the following process:</p>
<ol><li>We use GitHub Desktop to synchronise the latest version of the repository and help articles.</li>
<li>We add or edit help article files in Sublime or Write using Markdown.</li>
<li>We synchronise changes, wait for the deploy and do a final check that all looks good on the live site.</li>

</div>
</div>
<h2>Maintain a consistent style. Everywhere.</h2>
<p>To ensure our docs look great in the future, we added <a href="https://github.com/getvero/getvero.github.io#styleguide-and-rules" target="_blank">a section to the README file </a>that detailed the guidelines for creating or editing help articles. These included:</p>
<p>every time we made some significant style changes,</p>
<ul><li>
<p>when to <strong>bold text;</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when to use <em>italics</em>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when to use <code>code snippets</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and how to handle screenshots.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We host our CSS centrally on an AWS CloudFront server. This is managed on a second repository (<em>vero-styles)</em> that we&rsquo;ll make public in the near future. We&rsquo;ve written some simple Grunt scripts that make it easy to run CSS changes locally, deploy them to staging and also to deploy and invalidate them on our production CloudFront node. By having our styles on Cloudfront, we minimise the load time no matter where you are in the world by serving the assets from the closest server to your location. Another win for everyone.</p>
<p>The other benefit of separating the repositories is that no individual team member needs to touch or manage the CSS. And thanks to a well-documented style guide, it&rsquo;s still easy to ensure that the help articles, written in Markdown, will look great when it&rsquo;s deployed to production.</p>

<p>To make it easy to review and manage images and links, we have centralised <code>links.yml</code> and <code>screenshots.yml</code> files. When we need to change the images or update the links, we only need to do so in one place.</p>
<p>Our style guide outlines how to crop screenshots, where to put the image asset files and how to insert the file using our <code>screenshots.yml</code> file and Markdown.</p>
<p>These rules ensure we can maintain a body of help docs that is reliable, sensible and helpful.</p>
<h2>Address categories and &lsquo;Common Issues&rsquo;.</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7279" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/saas-help-docs/common-issues/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/common-issues.png?fit=931%2C668&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="931,668" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="common-issues" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/common-issues.png?fit=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/common-issues.png?fit=931%2C668&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7279" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/common-issues.png" alt="common-issues" width="931" height="668" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/common-issues.png?w=931&amp;ssl=1 931w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/common-issues.png?resize=300%2C215&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px"></p>
<p>The home page for our new help documentation is centred around categories, and a &lsquo;Common Issues&rsquo; section, where we highlight the most-asked questions.</p>
<p>In Jekyll, we created a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/" target="_blank">custom collection</a> to host our help articles so that we could define the sub-directory structure being used.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7277" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/saas-help-docs/jekyll-help-documentation-saas/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jekyll-help-documentation-saas.png?fit=902%2C534&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="902,534" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="jekyll-help-documentation-saas" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jekyll-help-documentation-saas.png?fit=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jekyll-help-documentation-saas.png?fit=902%2C534&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7277" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jekyll-help-documentation-saas.png" alt="jekyll-help-documentation-saas" width="902" height="534" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jekyll-help-documentation-saas.png?w=902&amp;ssl=1 902w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jekyll-help-documentation-saas.png?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px"></p>
<p>To do this, we had to define our own category management. We simply added three pieces of meta-data: <code>common_issues</code>, <code>getting_started</code> and <code>categories</code>. Each post can have a single category and, if present, the boolean value of <code>true</code> denotes that an article should also appear in the <em>Common Issues</em> and the soon-to-be-released <em>Getting started </em>headers on our help documentation.</p>
<p>This structure is easy for everyone on our team to understand and, thanks to Jekyll&rsquo;s instant compiling, makes it easy to add or remove categories by simply no longer using a category in any help article.</p>
<h2>Plugins and third-party tools</h2>
<p>In pulling our help articles together, we&rsquo;ve made great use of Algolia&rsquo;s Jekyll Plugin. We wanted to write about how we handled this but it was so easy, there isn&rsquo;t much to write.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7281" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/saas-help-docs/help-doc-search/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-doc-search.png?fit=936%2C466&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="936,466" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="help-doc-search" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-doc-search.png?fit=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-doc-search.png?fit=936%2C466&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7281" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-doc-search.png" alt="help-doc-search" width="936" height="466" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-doc-search.png?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/help-doc-search.png?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"></p>
<p>Basically, you install the plugin, index your help articles and then <em>go</em>. We added some extra styles to highlight terms that the customer has searched. Algolia makes this super easy by highlighting the search <em>facets</em> &ndash; so even that was too easy!</p>
<p>We have also used <a href="http://statuspage.io" target="_blank">StatusPage.io</a>&lsquo;s awesome Javascript embed library to show customers the current status of Vero and also to highlight any open issues.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="244px"><img data-attachment-id="7280" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/saas-help-docs/vero-status/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-status.png?fit=244%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="244,90" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero-status" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-status.png?fit=244%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-status.png?fit=244%2C90&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vero-status.png" alt="vero-status" width="244" height="90"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get carried away with features and plugins. Anytime we thought of new add-on to the help docs, we simply measured it against our guiding support principle,<em> &ldquo;does this help guide our customers?&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul><li>
<p>In the case of well-indexed, fast search, the answer is definitely &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a plugin to direct customers to our status page in the instance of issues, the answer is definitely &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of share buttons and comments, the answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul><p>By measuring everything against a single control, we eliminated a number of unnecessary features, spent less time on design and development, and created the most helpful help docs we possibly could.</p>
<h2>Quality help articles are a huge advantage.</h2>
<p>Vero is a technical product and a very flexible customer communication platform. Many of our customers have between five and 30 people logging into Vero &ndash; engineers, designers, marketers, product managers, support team members &ndash; and there is no way that all of those team members want to send emails to our support team when they have a question.</p>
<p>Great help articles guide new trial customers through the app. They help current customers learn new features. They help new team members get familiar with the software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to consider an approach that works for your team and your customers. Customer support goes a long way in this business, so don&rsquo;t skimp on it.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Each month, I update the Vero team on the blog. In the past, we&rsquo;ve kept these reports internal but starting today, we&rsquo;ll publish each report here on the blog.</p>
<p>These reports are pretty simple but it will give you an idea of what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes. Hopefully, it will provide some insight into how things work here at Vero and maybe even inspire you to try something new in your own marketing.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

</ol><p>We&rsquo;ve invested a lot of time and energy into improving our SEO. Those efforts started paying off big time in January. 13,634 organic search visits is a 40.96% increase over December and our best month ever. We&rsquo;ve finally recovered from the hit we took in August. (We changed a few key URLs and lost 30% of our search traffic overnight. Lesson learned.)</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>Without question, the biggest highlight in January was getting featured in the <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10" target="_blank">Moz Top 10</a>.

</ul><h2>What Worked, What Flopped</h2>
<p>Epic content works. In fact, epic content kills it.</p>
<p>In the last five months, our guides are responsible for 85,304 combined pageviews. That&rsquo;s insane. Expect more guides in the next few months.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">latest guide</a> was so massive that we actually split it into five chapters. We did this for readability and easier navigation but there was an unintended (and very positive) side effect. Instead of a single page, the guide was six pages. As people clicked through to the chapters, our bounce rate plummeted to 60% and our pageviews skyrocketed. The table of contents page has 12,029 pageviews but as a whole, the guide has 23,791 pageviews. That&rsquo;s nearly double!</p>
<p>Not all of our posts were popular however. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/the-principle-agent-problem/">The Principal-Agent Problem in Marketing</a>, for example, netted only 200 pageviews. The post was interesting but not actionable. Our readers let us know that it&rsquo;s not what they expect from the Vero blog. Lesson learned.</p>
<h2>On Tap for Next Month</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re continuing our SEO push with a tactic called <a href="http://www.bruceclay.com/seo/silo.htm">siloing</a>. I can&rsquo;t reveal exactly how we&rsquo;re doing it but I&rsquo;ll report on it in a future post. Trust us, it&rsquo;s a content strategy you&rsquo;re going to love.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also working on ensuring the blog is mobile-friendly, adding some additional navigation and redesigning our newsletter. Webinars have also become a key strategy for us and we&rsquo;ll be talking more about those in the future as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>At the end of September 2014, we took our first Vero team expedition to <em>Malaysia</em> for ten days.</p>
<p>We worked in <em>Kuala Lumpur</em> as a team.</p>
<p>We got our scuba open water certificates on <em>Pulau Tioman</em>.</p>
<p>We kicked some serious ass as a team. As part of this experience, there were a <strong>lot</strong> of really useful points on what worked well and what didn&rsquo;t that will guide our next team retreat. Rather than keep what worked and what didn&rsquo;t work to ourselves, the following is a real playbook you can use to run your own successful company retreat.</p>
<div class="toc title blue" id="playbook"><h2><span class="number">The playbook </span><span class="title">Activities for a retreat with results</span></h2></div>
<p>Going on retreat isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> about fun (though fun is important).</p>
<p>Below I&rsquo;ve published our schedule along with every activity we completed as a team for you to use as inspiration (or use wholesale if you want to) for your next team retreat.</p>
<p>To ensure we ran a team expedition that has <strong>real outputs</strong>, putting together a series of strategic activities focused on <strong>improving everyone&rsquo;s work and personal lives</strong> was vital.</p>
<p>We conducted nine such activities over the ten days in Malaysia. Designing each activity <strong>from scratch</strong>, I tried to create a flow from one activity to the next: starting the week by tackling everyone&rsquo;s frustrations, moving into sharing learnings and finishing the retreat by focusing on the <strong>practical</strong> things each team member could do to improve their lives <em>and</em> their work.</p>
<div class="toc title blue" id="One"><h2><span class="number">Activity One </span><span class="title">Why are we here?</span></h2></div>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Ask everyone in your team to take 5 minutes and introduce themselves, explaining <strong>how they ended up at your company</strong> and share <strong>one personal and one work goal they want from the team retreat</strong>. Set an intention for your time together!</p>
<p>The goal of this activity is to share how your company came to be for those who don&rsquo;t know, give everyone a chance to share their story and agree on some ideas for a core activity you&rsquo;ll work on together.</p>
<div class="toc title green" id="Two"><h2><span class="number">Activity Two </span><span class="title">The good, the bad and the ugly</span></h2></div>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> As an entire team, or in smaller logical groups (by department, by project team, etc.) take 10 minutes for each team member to write down three <strong>things they believe they do well</strong> at work, and three things <strong>they know they can improve on</strong>.</p>
<p>Ask everyone to take another 10 minutes to do the same about everyone in their discussion group.Get each group together and ask them to share their individual three <strong>bad points</strong>, and then have them ask the group to add any good or bad points they&rsquo;d like. Have each team member ask for <strong>advice on how they can improve on their bad points</strong>. Finally, have everyone share their three good points about the person they&rsquo;re discussing.</p>
<p>End on a positive.</p>
<p>The aim of this activity is to encourage transparency and provide a safe environment for people to air any grievances they have in their day-to-day working teams. Doing this early helps address any frustrations and, by focusing on how to improve and by asking everyone to read out their own bad points first and then moving to the good points, this activity ends up really positive.<br>
<div class="toc title red" id="Three"><h2><span class="number">Activity Three </span><span class="title">Not a moment to lose</span></h2></div></p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Ask everyone on your team to take 10 minutes and write down <strong>exactly what they do</strong> on a typical working day. Share, as a group, your typical day and highlight which aspects you&rsquo;d like to improve, both personally and professionally.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps you&rsquo;d like to make an hour each day to go to the gym. Discuss as a group how you can help each other reach your goals in designing a better lifestyle. This goal should focus both on work (e.g. <em>&ldquo;I will only check my email in the mornings after 11am&rdquo;</em>) and on your personal life (e.g. <em>&ldquo;I will go for a run three times per week&rdquo;</em>). It helps everyone understand how everyone else operates and what drives them &ndash; this gives great perspective.<br>
<div class="toc title purple" id="Four"><h2><span class="number">Activity Four </span><span class="title">See you in the year 3000</span></h2></div></p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Have everyone spend 10-15 minutes writing down how they envision your company one year, three years and five years from now. Have the team focus on:</p>
<ul><li>Size</li>
<li>Location(s)</li>
<li>Team structure</li>
<li>Product(s)</li>
<li>Revenue</li>
<li>Growth channels</li>
<li>Values</li>
</ul><p>Then discuss everyone&rsquo;s vision as a team and work out what needs to change in order to reach the goals set out. Ask each team member individually what they feel needs to be focused on or systematized in order to reach the visions they outlined (hint: if the answers are that nothing needs to change, they&rsquo;re not thinking big enough!)</p>

<div class="toc title orange" id="Five"><h2><span class="number">Activity Five </span><span class="title">You're the boss</span></h2></div></p>
<p>Activity five should, ideally, follow task four straight away (a two hour block in total).</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Give everyone five minutes to reflect on the last session and then ask them to spend 10-15 minutes and write down who they&rsquo;d hire if they <strong>had to hire four team members to work with them directly over the next 12 months</strong> (it could be more than four, if you&rsquo;re a lot bigger).</p>
<p>Ask them to then think about how they&rsquo;d grow your company $XX,000/month in order to hire the four people they want. What marketing or customer success activities would they focus on, and how would those activities generate revenue?</p>
<p>The aim of this is to help your team see how they could personally grow over the next 12 months and get them thinking of ways to achieve these goals which, in turn, help the company succeed as a whole. This was a fun task! Particularly enlightening to see how different everyone&rsquo;s opinions are.<br>
<div class="toc title blue" id="Six"><h2><span class="number">Activity Six </span><span class="title">Sharing is caring</span></h2></div></p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Each team member spends 10 minutes <strong>teaching</strong> the rest of the team about a topic they are familiar with.</p>
<p>For example, our CTO, James, explained the principles behind email deliverability and our marketing manager, Jimmy, explained the principles of SEO. The aim of this task is to have everyone educate the rest of the team about what they work on and give them ideas how they can help.<br>
<div class="toc title green" id="Seven"><h2><span class="number">Activity Seven </span><span class="title">What matters most</span></h2></div></p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Everyone on the team takes 30 minutes to write down three to five core values for the company. The focus is not on buzzwords like &lsquo;Innovation&rsquo; but core, human principles. We asked everyone to write down one to two sentences per core principle, describing how this principle manifests at Vero and what it should truly represent.</p>
<p>As a team, we then spoke about the principles and found common ground between everyone&rsquo;s suggestions. We then wrote down the values we all agreed on.</p>
<p>This task helps bring the team together and, if you&rsquo;re a young company, define an initial set of <strong>values</strong>. Values are <strong>so important</strong> in life: they allow you to make decisions faster and consistently. All you need to do is ask &ldquo;does this fit with our values?&rdquo;. If the answer is yes, then you know you&rsquo;ll be happy with the decision in the future, regardless of what happens.<br>
<div class="toc title red" id="Eight"><h2><span class="number">Activity Eight </span><span class="title">Lightening talks</span></h2></div></p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Everyone on the team presents to everyone else something they&rsquo;ve been working on recently. For example, perhaps someone has gotten into meditation, perhaps someone has learnt to program NodeJS, perhaps someone on the team has been traveling every weekend.</p>
<p>The goal is to share something you&rsquo;re doing to improve your life and share the lessons you&rsquo;ve learned, and how these lessons might be implemented by others on the team (if they want to). It&rsquo;s about sharing fun, passionate ideas. People with passion are the best kind of people &ndash; encourage passion!</p>
<p>On the Vero retreat we shared a ton of great stories, from focusing on happiness, to doing yoga to playing team sports and implementing game-like ideas for tasks at work. All of the things we shared gave everyone genuine ideas they could try when they got home in order to bring new aspects into their lives and expand their worldview.<br>
<div class="toc title purple" id="Nine"><h2><span class="number">Activity Nine </span><span class="title">The three most important questions</span></h2></div></p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><strong>Task:</strong> Taken from the wonderful Vishen and the folks at <a href="http://mindvalley.com" target="_blank">Mindvalley</a>, everyone on the team took seven minutes to listen and complete the <strong>Three Most Important Questions</strong> exercise:<iframe width="850" height="478" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/f8eU5Pc-y0g?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>Everyone shared the outcomes of this process (on paper) with everyone else. It was awesome to see what everyone wants to achieve personally and professionally.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic task to round out the retreat as everyone ends on a really positive note and can use the outputs from previous exercises to set fantastic goals for themselves, plus it&rsquo;s nice to end on a positive note!</p>
<div class="toc title orange" id="structure"><h2><span class="number">The structure </span><span class="title">A format that works</span></h2></div>
<p>One thing I learnt from running the expedition was what an ideal format for a retreat might look like, based on success and failures. Here is the exact schedule we followed:<img data-attachment-id="4807" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/guides/team-retreat/screen-shot-2014-11-18-at-4-53-51-pm/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?fit=1258%2C433&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1258,433" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2014-11-18 at 4.53.51 pm" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?fit=300%2C103&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?fit=1024%2C352&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4807" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-11-18 at 4.53.51 pm" width="1258" height="433" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?w=1258&amp;ssl=1 1258w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?resize=300%2C103&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?resize=1024%2C352&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?resize=291%2C100&amp;ssl=1 291w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?resize=50%2C17&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-18-at-4.53.51-pm.png?resize=75%2C26&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><a class="btn btn-large btn-primary" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z9cJOApVUGzc8yctk35Ukcp8tAR2JsMShFKbt_O6dCE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Open in Google Sheets</a></p>
<p>The most surprisingly lesson: <strong>people wanted more time to work</strong> when they&rsquo;re together!</p>
<p>Though we had around one and a half full days of strategic sessions and another three days working, everyone would have been happy to work long into the night together for five solid days. Something about being away and in a happy place meant people were keen to <strong>work</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend a few key points. The two biggest takeaways were:</p>
<p>1. Work together for four to five full days on a common project <strong>at the start of the retreat</strong>. By getting everyone in one place in the same room, discussing the big picture and working extremely focused on a single core task allows you to achieve <strong>a lot</strong>. Everyone on the will be extremely inspired to achieve the common goal.</p>
<p>2. Spend the last two days and two nights having an <em>amazing</em> time. If you can <strong>do something together that everyone can take away</strong>, you&rsquo;re even further ahead. Doing scuba together was a great experience for us: everyone pushed their comfort zone, had to rely on each other and had a lot of fun BUT, what&rsquo;s even better, is that everyone now has their open water certification and can dive on their own, or together, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a killer takeaway for the company and everyone as individuals.This is something we want to keep alive at Vero on future expeditions: what can we learn together for the good of everyone as an individual that also bonds us as a company.</p>
<div class="toc title blue" id="you crazy?"><h2><span class="number">Are you crazy? </span><span class="title">Why you should run such a gratuitous team retreat</span></h2></div>
<p>Work is a <strong>huge</strong> part of most people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>For myself, the work I do each day is not &lsquo;work&rsquo; at all, simply because I enjoy every day, face challenges with a positive attitude and have intertwined work with my life such that I get value and enjoyment from the hours I&rsquo;m in the office <strong>and</strong> the hours I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>One of my key goals as the CEO and founder of a company is to create a workplace where people actually <em>want</em> to work, just like I do. So far, so good!</p>
<p>A huge part of this is working with people who love learning new things and who focus on being positive, yet another core part is providing a workplace that is challenging, interesting and exciting. A team <strong>expedition</strong> to a foreign country, expanding everyone&rsquo;s horizons and challenging their visions of the future &ndash; for the company and as individuals &ndash; really helps set the tone for what we want to achieve as a company: exploring new territory, achieving huge goals and having fun as a team at the same time. Our time in Malaysia was absolutely worth it and we can&rsquo;t wait to do it again next time.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>We&rsquo;re an email marketing company but we&rsquo;re trying to grow a business just like you.</p>
<p>It seems logical to share our ideas, challenges, successes and failures with you. If this blog were <em>only</em> about email, we&rsquo;d be withholding a lot of knowledge about marketing, business development and sales.</p>
<p>This post is going to examine the strategy behind out latest email guide &ndash; <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">Email Marketing Best Practices: 20 Tips for Dramatically Better Email</a> &ndash; to show you how we wrote it and promoted it. No secrets here &hellip; we&rsquo;ll share the numbers and, if you have questions, we&rsquo;ll be happy to answer them.</p>
<h2>Why an Email Company Spends So Much Time on Content Marketing</h2>
<p>Vero is an email marketing company but email isn&rsquo;t the only way we communicate with our users and it&rsquo;s certainly not the only way we grow. In Vero&rsquo;s early days, our CEO Chris Hexton started blogging about creative ways to use email after realizing that so many people were struggling to execute effective campaigns.</p>
<p>The blog has grown steadily ever since, peaking at 43,000+ pageviews (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/inside-the-vero-blog/">more on that here</a>) in April 2014.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4660" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/epic-post-breakdown/vero-blog-growth-ga/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?fit=996%2C241&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="996,241" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero blog growth GA" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?fit=300%2C73&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?fit=996%2C241&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4660" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png" alt="vero blog growth GA" width="996" height="241" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?w=996&amp;ssl=1 996w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?resize=300%2C73&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?resize=50%2C12&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vero-blog-growth-GA.png?resize=75%2C18&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px"></p>
<p>Recently, we&rsquo;ve made some <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/revamped-content-strategy/">changes to our content strategy</a>. The idea is to publish less frequently but in greater detail. You&rsquo;ll see more behind-the-scenes posts like this one on the blog along with monthly &ldquo;epic&rdquo; content like our <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">latest guide</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what it takes to put together epic content that drives more traffic and leads than in a month than 12 blog posts.</p>
<h2>Brainstorming Epic Ideas</h2>
<p>We brainstormed topics long before we started writing. Initially, Chris and I were planning to create a massive list (500+) of email resources and tools. We actually started collecting the resources &ndash; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qFbtffYB-QzvPvopU-P42mszchr_OGQvBM3qyq23LUA/edit?usp=sharing">see the list here</a> &ndash; before deciding that it just wasn&rsquo;t actionable enough. (This is an idea we may revisit later &hellip; let us know if you think it&rsquo;s a good idea in the comments.)</p>
<p>The idea for the guide that was ultimately created was inspired by Brian Dean of <a href="http://backlinko.com">Backlinko</a>. Rather than starting with a content idea, Brian recommends starting with a keyword. We chose &ldquo;email marketing best practices&rdquo; because we believe the content currently ranking for this phrase is outdated and unhelpful. We knew we could create something way better. Brian refers to this as the <a href="http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique">Skyscraper Technique</a> &ndash; see what ranks for the keywords you want and outdo them.</p>
<p>Once we settled on the keyword, we followed Brian&rsquo;s template for expanded list posts. Rather than churn out another hollow list post, we planned to spend extra time loading each email marketing tip with examples, screenshots and actionable advice. <strong>The result was a 5,000-word post with 40 examples and an accompanying swipe file.</strong></p>
<p>We wrote the draft in Penflip (<a href="https://www.penflip.com/jimmydaly/september-epic-content">see it here</a>) so that we could easily collaborate on it without passing docs back and forth. Then, we set about designing the post. We drew inspiration from our friends at HelpScout and Groove, and added our own zest in the form of a beautiful table of contents.</p>

<p>The stage was set: a massive and useful guide, a beautiful design and, perhaps most important, a promotion strategy.</p>
<h2>Content Promotion, aka Making Someone Else&rsquo;s Life Easier</h2>
<p>Content promotion and link building get a bad rap. Our outreach strategy hinges on building actually relationships with people in our industry. Here are a few ways that we built links and got shares to this guide, along with the actual emails I sent.</p>
<p>If you take a closer look at the guide, you&rsquo;ll notice that we built in easy opportunities for sharing. Next to each tip is a button. Clicking that button opens a pre-populated tweet with a tweet unique to that tip.</p>
<p>This button&hellip;</p>

<p>The next thing we did was contact everyone mentioned on this list. I scoured each of their sites until I found the right person to talk to, then sent them an email or tweet. Here is a sampling of outreach that result in a share:</p>

<p>When it comes to link building, the fastest and easiest way to get links is to get featured in daily or weekly content roundups. To do this, simply search for &ldquo;[industry] roundups&rdquo; published within the last month. That way, you know they are current and publishing regularly.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been responsible for writing daily or weekly roundups, you know how hard to can be to discover fresh content. Unsolicited contributions can make your life <em>way</em> easier (assuming the content is good). When reaching out to other writers, <strong>your sole mission should be to make their life easier</strong>.</p>

<p>You get the idea. I did this over and over via email, Twitter, Facebook and Google+. Another great benefit of being included in roundups is that most blog send a newsletter that you might be included in also. As the post started to gain traction, it was also picked up by a few other blogs, as well as Buffer&rsquo;s suggested content list and GrowthHackers.com.</p>
<p>As of October 24, we&rsquo;ve accumulated 309 links from 47 different domains and a lot of shares. Awesome!</p>

<h2>Does Epic Content Work?</h2>
<p>For us, the important question is whether publishing one epic post per month is better than publishing 2-3 posts per week. Here&rsquo;s a look at the numbers.</p>
<p>In September, we published 12 blogs posts. On the last day of the month, we released the epic guide and have published three other short posts since.</p>

<p>So far, we are thrilled with the results and are already in the process of creating a new epic guide for next month. Stay tuned! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://blog.thefetch.com/2014/07/05/the-world-on-your-terms-why-you-can-start-a-successful-business-anywhere/" target="_blank" rel="canonical">The Fetch Blog</a>.</em></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">It is common thinking that you need to be in San Francisco to start a big software company, in Paris to create the world&rsquo;s best restaurant and on Wall Street to build the a successful hedge fund.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s simply not true.</p>
<p>Should Atlassian have thrived in Sydney? How did Noma become the best restaurant in the world, in Denmark?</p>
<p><strong>These people broke the rules, and so can you.</strong></p>
<p>There are three things that can empower you to start a company with major growth potential, no matter where you are:</p>
<ol><li><strong>A global focus.</strong> When you&rsquo;re driving a car at speed if you focus directly on an object, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll hit it. Similarly, if you&rsquo;re focused on being the best in your home market, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll be. If, however, you dream of being the best in the world from day one, you&rsquo;re much more likely to find a way to turn this dream into practical steps that lead to reality.</li>
<li><strong>Access to the tools you need.</strong> Technology has changed the way we work. &acirc;&#128;&#156;Work&acirc;&#128;&#157; is now an action, not a place. This means that with a fast net connection and some elbow grease, you can serve clients all over the world from your home town, wherever that may be. Invest in the other tools you need to be successful &acirc;&#128;&#147; top-of-the-line computers, video conferencing gear, high-end software and most importantly, people. The right team can raise your company to new levels time and time again.</li>
<li><strong>A passion for where you live.</strong> If you aren&rsquo;t happy, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to succeed at building a business. In order to maintain the necessary motivation and drive, it&rsquo;s key to spend your time in a place you love. Whether that&rsquo;s San Francisco, Sydney, Stockholm or Shanghai, the right atmosphere will fuel you with energy.</li>
</ol><h2>1. Global focus</h2>
<p>When <a href="http://twitter.com/jylamont">James</a> and I started Vero, we lived in San Francisco. After just six months we decided to move back home to Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>A big part of this decision was that we had committed to bootstrapping Vero and needed as much support as we could get from friends, family and the home city we knew and loved.</p>
<p>Over a year later, we&rsquo;re more than happy with how things have turned out and how bright the future looks. The biggest fear we had before we returned to Australia was that people wouldn&rsquo;t take us seriously.</p>
<p>After all, &ldquo;<em>Why would customers in Europe or the US care about someone from Australia?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turns out that if you deliver a product that people want and customer service that impresses, customers don&rsquo;t get hung up on location.</p>
<p>Moreover, we don&rsquo;t act like we&rsquo;re solely interested in Australian customers. In fact, <strong>we think big</strong>.</p>
<p>Everything we do &ndash; from marketing and customer support to development and strategy &ndash; is designed to help grow Vero into one of the world&rsquo;s key email service providers. We wonder how we can build a template editor as good as Mailchimp&rsquo;s, an audience as inspired as KISSmetrics&rsquo; and revenue as quickly as Dropbox.</p>
<p>Keeping a global attitude can be hard when you&rsquo;re not &lsquo;in the thick of it&rsquo; but there are a few things that have helped us keep our eyes on the prize:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Competitors around the globe.</strong> From San Francisco to Paris, Vero has competitors that we respect. Keeping the fire alive and challenging us to grow as fast as (and even faster) than these great companies is a huge help in terms of ambition and global focus.</li>
<li><strong>The hunt for customers on the cutting edge.</strong> At Vero, customers that spend time exploring how email can grow their business are a pleasure to work with. Finding customers that want to push the boundaries usually means looking to the global leaders, regardless of where they&rsquo;re located. We have amazing customers in Berlin, New York, Mexico and Israel, and we&rsquo;ve seen first hand just how smart people are. These customers are located in some of the world&rsquo;s most exciting cities and they inspire us each and every day.</li>
<li><strong>An open mind.</strong> Is it cool to have customers in Berlin that have more customers than the entire population of Australia? Damn right it&rsquo;s cool. Is it cool to have built something that helps them connect with these customers? We live in a crazy, high-speed, global world and you need to embrace every minute of it.</li>
</ul><h2>2. The tools</h2>
<p>You need to be in a place that has everything you need.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a 23-year-old bootstrapping the dream, this might be your parent&rsquo;s basement for a while. If you need $2 million, then you&rsquo;re going to need investors. If you need a tech team of four, then you&rsquo;ll have to find them.</p>
<p>Where can you best get the resources you need? At home, abroad, somewhere cheaper? I remember reading an article in Monocle advocating the pros of starting a company in your home city. The statistics suggested success rates were generally higher, as founders can get what they need from trusted connections they have made throughout their lives.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that legal, tax, employment and other advice has been easy for me to find at Vero here in Sydney: never more than a single phone call away. This has helped us immensely to date.</p>
<h2>3. A passion for where you live</h2>
<p>When my co-founder, Damien, sent me this photo a few mornings ago &ndash; and this is just around the corner from where he lives &ndash; it was a reminder of the passion and joy he has for where he lives (sunny Manly, in Sydney).</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/coffee.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There is an important distinction between &lsquo;comfortable&rsquo; and &lsquo;complacent&rsquo;. You constantly need to find ways to raise the bar but, when so much of this comes motivating forces like customers, competitors and even an entrepreneurs internal fire to prove they can win, it&rsquo;s important to live in a place you love, not hate.</p>
<p>This could be San Francisco or New York City, it could be Sydney or London, or it could even be Chang Mai. There comes a time in any business where most people can&rsquo;t work 16 hour days every day. Rest is important (science says so, as does common sense). Being somewhere you can do the things you love, such as surfing in the morning, makes for happier people.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>There is something profound about controlling your schedule. When your day-to-day life isn&rsquo;t shaped traditional office hours or someone else&rsquo;s schedule, work doesn&rsquo;t really feel like work anymore.</p>
<p><strong>We operate in a <a href="http://jimmydaly.com/defining-hard-work-for-a-new-generation-of-laborers">creative economy</a>, not a labor economy. It&rsquo;s time to evolve the way we work.</strong></p>
<p>At Vero, we code, create, write, design, market, think, analyze and communicate. We create value, not physical products. This is happening all over the world right now and it&rsquo;s the exact reason we are evolving into a remote company. Empowering employees to be happy instills a sense of purpose in our work. As <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/09/whatever-happened-to-labor.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin says</a>:</p>
<hr><p class="wp-caption-text">&ldquo;The future of labor belongs to enlightened, passionate people on both sides of the plant, people who want to do work that matters.&rdquo;</p>
<hr><p>The purpose of this blog is to give you an inside look at our company and a few reasons why we choose to work this way.</p>
<h2>Focus on productivity, not work.</h2>

<p>Sydney, Australia is 18 hours ahead of Tucson, Ariz. When I start working in the morning, my co-workers are (hopefully) fast asleep. When their day gets going, mine is winding down. We overlap for a few hours each day, so we jump on Google Hangouts to chat and prioritize our work for the hours when we work independently. Because I&rsquo;m not tied to a traditional schedule, I sometimes find myself starting work later and finishing work later. If I have things planned after work, I start early and finish a bit early. I take my dog for a few walks during the day, take a break to exercise and spend a little time cooking a healthy lunch.</p>
<p><strong>These perks are priceless.</strong> They remove so much of the stress related to work and allow me to be even more productive when I am working.</p>
<p>Buffer co-founder Leo Widrich wrote a great post on the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/optimal-work-time-how-long-should-we-work-every-day-the-science-of-mental-strength">Buffer blog</a> explaining why our bodies need these breaks in order to be productive.</p>
<blockquote><p>The basic understanding is that our human minds can focus on any given task for 90-120 minutes. Afterwards, a 20-30 minute break is required for us to get the renewal to achieve high performance for our next task again. Here is a better representation of the ultradian rhythm:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/tudpizdwjbehdg_small.jpg?ssl=1" alt="PIC-3.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So instead of thinking about &ldquo;What can I get done in an 8 hour day&rdquo;, I&acirc;&#128;&#153;ve started to change my thinking to &ldquo;What can I get done in a 90 min session&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This simple change in mindset has a massive effect on the culture of our startup. Slogging away for hours at a time is not only counterproductive, it&rsquo;s miserable. A focus on optimization helps us gear our entire lives towards making the most out of work, recreation and rest.</p>
<h2>Empower a healthy work-life balance.</h2>

<p>Perhaps one benefit of working a normal 9-5 schedule is that most of your email happens during those hours. If everyone works the same schedule, communication dies off in the evening and revs up again in the morning.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t true for an international startup. There is a trickle of emails coming through nearly 24 hours a day, with surges during our respective mornings. In some ways, this makes it hard to disconnect. Again, however, a simple change in perspective makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Our CEO <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/about/" target="_blank">Chris Hexton</a> often asks us questions like &ldquo;Where do you want to live?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What goals do you want to accomplish in life?&rdquo; Those are important questions and not necessarily work-related, until he follows it up with <em>&ldquo;How can Vero help you get there?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>This mindset makes the work-life balance easier to manage since it empowers us to use work to accomplish personal goals. After all, <strong>career goals should be personal goals</strong>. The traditional office environment has zapped us of that reality. When work and personal life are too separate, it becomes impossibly difficult to accomplish goals that should be achievable.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that spending all hours of the night answering emails is the answer but it gets employees to buy-in to the company&rsquo;s goals as well as their own. It&rsquo;s a win-win.</p>
<h2>Attract the best of the best.</h2>

<p>When it comes time to hire new folks, Vero isn&rsquo;t limited by location. The best candidate for the job, regardless of location &ndash; in most cases, but some employees do need to be in the same office &ndash; can be hired.</p>
<p>This opens up a world of possibilities but it does offer a unique set of challenges. For example, the best person for the job probably is looking for a new job. And that person might never have even considered that working remotely is an option. This approach to work is growing quickly but many of the best tech people are unaware that working for a company 7,814 miles away is a real possibility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find these people. There are handful of sites, like <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/">We Work Remotely</a>, that help but we need to find ways to reach the people who aren&rsquo;t looking. It&rsquo;s an ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>One other challenge is that working from home has gotten a bad rap. Just listen to this recent article on <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/jamie-varon/2014/06/20-daily-battles-only-people-who-work-from-home-have-to-deal-with/">Thought Catalog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The more time you spend alone, the less you are able to connect and interact with other humans. Your friends will be all, &ldquo;So, what have you been up to?&rdquo; And you will seriously not have one thing to share.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cynical approach that&rsquo;s missing all the things that make working from home great. The flip side &ndash; <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/05/your_commute_is_killing_you.html">commuting each and every day</a> &ndash; isn&rsquo;t exactly an exciting alternative.</p>
<blockquote><p>Commuting is a migraine-inducing life-suck &ndash; a mundane task about as pleasurable as assembling flat-pack furniture or getting your license renewed, and you have to do it every day. If you are commuting, you are not spending quality time with your loved ones. You are not exercising, doing challenging work, having sex, petting your dog, or playing with your kids (or your Wii). You are not doing any of the things that make human beings happy. Instead, you are getting nauseous on a bus, jostled on a train, or cut off in traffic.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my personal experience, working remotely means I get to spend more time with my wife and dog, the freedom to exercise any time of day and the ability to run little errands that I would otherwise have to save for the weekend.</p>
<p>Do you work remotely? Or wish you worked remotely? Or hate working remotely? We&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on the topic. Just drop a note in the comments.</p>

<html><body><p>There are hundreds of tools that are designed to help you manage projects &hellip; Asana, Trello, Basecamp, Pivotal, etc.</p>
<p>Too often I see people get caught up with the <strong>tool itself</strong> instead of <strong>how to use the tool effectively</strong>.</p>
<p>At Vero, <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> is the <strong>only</strong> task management we have to run our entire company:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4351" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/team-management/trello-vero-project-management/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?fit=800%2C267&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,267" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="trello-vero-project-management" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?fit=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?fit=800%2C267&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4351" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png" alt="trello-vero-project-management" width="800" height="267" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?resize=50%2C17&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trello-vero-project-management.png?resize=75%2C25&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Simplicity, Honesty, Accountability</h2>
<p>I recently watched a video from <a href="https://twitter.com/Vishen">Vishen</a>, <a href="http://www.mindvalley.com/about/ajit-nawalkha">Ajit</a> and the great team over at <a href="http://www.mindvalleyacademy.com">Mindvalley</a>.</p>
<p>Vishen explained that his key to keeping each of his businesses on track is thinking, on a six month basis, about the five things that really matter to increase revenue.</p>
<p>An example for Vero would be <em>increase average revenue per user (ARPU)</em> which, specifically, might mean <em>20% of signups should have subscriber lists over 50,000</em>.</p>
<p>This should then trickle down so that each week, and each day, you are only working on tasks directly supporting those five key goals. If you do this, there is no way you cannot increase revenue or profit, as your goals dictate.</p>
<p>This aligns nicely with how we&rsquo;ve been working at Vero. Here are our three key takeaways:</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>We all work from the same Trello board. This ensures everyone can see what everyone else is working on.</p>
<p>Tasks should only be <strong>on</strong> the board if they support our six-month goals, can be tackled this week and are assigned to a person.</p>
<p>If they do not meet the criteria, there are two options:</p>
<ol><li>If the task is to be addressed later this month, it is stored on a list within the master plan board. This should never be more than 20-30 items long.</li>
<li>If it is on a timeline further out that this, it can be removed from the board. In reference to something I learned from <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">37Signals</a> is that the major customer pain points and critical product ideas <strong>will not die</strong>. They will be so ubiquitous, asked for and discussed that, when you move to the next stage, you&rsquo;ll be able to <strong>better</strong> prioritise what needs work.</li>
</ol><p>Keep it simple.</p>
<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>The key to this single board is <strong>being up front</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>You cannot change what you cannot confront.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have a weekly standup meeting where everyone discusses what they&rsquo;re working on. Tasks are sliced, diced and removed regularly. Most of all we encourage each other to ask &ldquo;will this really be done or worked on this week&rdquo; and &ldquo;is this the most important thing I should be doing right now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t answer those questions with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then we refine what we&rsquo;re working on or remove the task.</p>
<p>The key is to <strong>be upfront</strong>. There is no point pretending you&rsquo;ll meet a deadline if you know you never can.</p>
<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>As CEO, I see my job as clearing roadblocks.</p>
<blockquote><p>If someone on the team is stuck, needs a contact or can&rsquo;t move forward as fast as they&rsquo;d like, it&rsquo;s my job to solve this.</p></blockquote>
<p>I consistently ask everyone what they&rsquo;re working on and, if it deviates from the plan we agreed as a team, challenge why things have altered. Nine times out of ten this automatically helps the person see that they&rsquo;ve lost focus or have hit a roadblock they need help solving.</p>
<p>This helps keep the wheels turning and everyone focused and happy &hellip; there is nothing worse than banging your head against a wall. So by ensuring people are accountable to their goals we can quickly find roadblocks and, hopefully, remove them.</p>
<p>Stick to the plan and, where you can&rsquo;t, identify <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>So far this method works well for us. Naturally, as the team grows, we&rsquo;ll have to adapt. It&rsquo;s my hunch that as the team becomes 10, instead of five, we&rsquo;ll simply break into core groups and these groups will manage their own Trello boards in the same way, reporting between each other via a &lsquo;Master&rsquo; board.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how it unfolds!</p>

<html><body><p>As you likely already saw, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/">we redesigned the Vero blog</a>!</p>
<p>This seemed like the perfect time to share some data about our blog and how it&rsquo;s grown over the last two or so years. I&rsquo;ve also had several people have ask me about our content strategy recently so I&rsquo;m excited to share this information and get feedback from you, our awesome readers.</p>
<p>But first, here are two dirty secrets about our success:</p>
<ol><li>I love chatting about content strategy and will do so anytime, so feel free to hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_daly">Twitter</a></li>
<li><strong>There is no secret</strong></li>
</ol><p>Ah, the painful truth!</p>
<p>Like most things in life, there are no shortcuts when it comes to growing a successful blog. Sure, there are hacks, tips and tricks we use to get our content in front of new people but <strong>nothing compares to consistency</strong>.</p>
<p>We have some interesting data to share but first, here&rsquo;s some context for our redesign.</p>
<h2>Community First</h2>
<p>In the old days of the internet &ndash; the 1990s and early 2000s &ndash; blogs were a crude form of social media. People used blogs to share thoughts, links, resources and media. Blogs brought people together to discuss ideas and start movements.</p>
<p>At some point, businesses realized they could use blogs as a marketing tool and the idea of community-first resources fell apart. Now we have content marketing, which is too often an industrialized process crafted in a boardroom. Real blogs are harder to find but more valuable than ever.</p>
<p>When we decided to re-design our blog, which had been running on a slightly customized, free WordPress theme for about two years, we made a conscious effort to keep the look and feel of a &ldquo;blog&rdquo;. There are plenty of online magazines, content hubs and &ldquo;news&rdquo; sites out there but that isn&rsquo;t our cup of tea. Sticking to a more traditional blogging format is part of a conscious effort to keep our content focused on our community and not pageviews.</p>
<p>The new site should help readability and improve navigation but there are no major changes. It looks better but it&rsquo;s still a blog and we still plan to publish things that actually help you get better at email marketing. After all, if we spent too much time and energy changing everything, we wouldn&rsquo;t have time to write, research, read and converse with all of you. We are really excited about the refresh and hope it makes your experience with the Vero blog better than ever.</p>
<h2>One Blog&rsquo;s Journey from 0 &ndash; 43,000 visitors</h2>
<p>With all that being said, pageviews are one important way we measure our success. It&rsquo;s not the only way and it&rsquo;s not the most important way, but it&rsquo;s a yardstick we can look to each month to how we are progressing. Our most important feedback comes in the form of comments, emails and tweets.</p>

<p>&hellip;have way more to do with the resources we create than the data we see in Google Analytics. But I know you want to see the data, so here you go. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The Vero blog was born in June 2012 but we didn&rsquo;t take it too seriously until early 2013. I have data as far back as May 2013 and I thought it would be fun to share with people as we begin the next chapter of our blog. Here is a look at our traffic, which has grown from 5,000 monthly visits to more than 36,000 (with a peak over 43,000!).</p>

<p>And here is a look at where this traffic is coming from:</p>

<p>A few things about this data:</p>
<p><strong>What the heck happened in April?</strong></p>
<p>April was a huge month for us. We published a post titled <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/">50 Marketing Blogs You Should Read Every Day</a> that exploded on social media. Buffer kicked that off by including the post in their &ldquo;Suggestions&rdquo; list. This was back there when there only five suggestions per day and each one got tons of attention. That single post has netted more than 20,000 pageviews since and been shared 3,100+ times. It was the second of our three &ldquo;epic&rdquo; endeavors so far this year.</p>
<p><strong>What else contributed to growth?</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Epic&rdquo; content has been huge for us. We&rsquo;ve now taken on three massive guides that are freely available on the site. We made them free &ndash; as opposed to using them as e-books or offers &ndash; because we wanted to leverage them for search. In addition to being instrumental in helping us reach new readers, these epic pieces are also the foundation of our internal linking strategy.</p>
