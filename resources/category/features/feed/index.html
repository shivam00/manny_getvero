<html><body><p>Recently, one of our loyal blog readers sent us a note that read something like this: &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know Vero could do <em>all that</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We try to keep the blog focused on <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/">educational email content</a> and we almost never sell. But today, we want to explain <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features/">what exactly Vero does</a> since, apparently, we haven&rsquo;t done a very good job in the past!</p>
<p>If you dig it, why not <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/pricing/" target="_blank">give Vero a spin</a>? It&rsquo;s totally free and you can finally put all these good marketing lessons into action.</p>
<p>Here are nine things you can do with Vero.</p>
<h2>1. You can send real behavioral emails.</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever read the Vero blog before, you know we <em>love</em> behavioral email. It&rsquo;s the future of email and our users have the ability to trigger emails based on just about any user behavior.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Nudge Email</strong>: A customer views a product page twice but doesn&rsquo;t make a purchase. You can trigger an email with a 24-hour coupon code encouraging them to act immediately.</li>
<li><strong>The Replenishment Email</strong>: If you sell a product that customers need to buy over and over (say, for example, dog food), you can automatically trigger an email 30 days after a purchase reminding customers to buy again.</li>
<li><strong>The Smart Planner Email</strong>: Let&rsquo;s say you run a travel booking site. A customer searches for a hotel over a long weekend but doesn&rsquo;t book. You can trigger an email to be sent two weeks before the dates they searched for letting them know the listing is still available.</li>
<li><strong>The Retention Email:</strong> This email works for marketers in just about every vertical. When a user <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> take action &ndash; i.e. they haven&rsquo;t logged in, purchased, etc. &ndash; trigger an email reminding them to come back and asking how you can help.</li>
</ul><p>And here are some real-life examples on our blog:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/">Airbnb</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/behavioral-email-ideas/">Target</a></li>
</ul><p>Behavioral emails are the lifeblood of lifecycle marketing. We encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/blog/lifecycle-emails/" target="_blank">Samuel Hulick&rsquo;s post on HelpScout</a> for some great info on lifecycle email.</p>

<h2>2. You can send awesome transactional emails.</h2>
<p>Transactional emails are hidden gems in the lifecycle email marketing world. People <em>love</em> transactional emails. In fact, they are opened at up to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/" target="_blank">8x the rate</a> as promotional email. <strong>That&rsquo;s insane</strong>.</p>
<p>Vero gives you control over your transactional emails (invoices, receipts, shipping confirmations, account usage, etc.), so you can make them 1) look great and 2) move users closer to your marketing goals.</p>
<p>Now, you can&rsquo;t sell things in a transactional email &ndash; that&rsquo;s actually <a href="http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business" target="_blank">illegal</a> &ndash; but you can add marketing value to them.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul><li>Add a referral code to your email receipts</li>
<li>Encourage customer to follow you on Facebook and Twitter in your invoices</li>
<li>Include onboarding content in your shipping confirmations so customers can start using your product immediately</li>
</ul><p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/uber-receipt.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/">The Complete Guide to Transactional Email</a> for tons of examples on this.</p>
<h2>3. You can send newsletters, promotions and drip campaigns, too.</h2>
<p>Vero is designed for advanced email marketing but our users can still send newsletters, promotional email and drip campaigns. There&rsquo;s nothing <em>wrong</em> with this type of email marketing, it&rsquo;s just been abused by so many people.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="497px"><img data-attachment-id="4902" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/vero-email-marketing/vero-email-drip-campaign/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?fit=497%2C419&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="497,419" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero email drip campaign" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?fit=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?fit=497%2C419&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4902" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png" alt="vero email drip campaign" width="497" height="419" border="1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?w=497&amp;ssl=1 497w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?resize=119%2C100&amp;ssl=1 119w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?resize=50%2C42&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vero-email-drip-campaign.png?resize=75%2C63&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px"></p>
<p>In our own marketing, we use behavioral emails for onboarding, transactional emails for communication about accounts, newsletters for our blog subscribers, promotional email for special events and drip campaigns for new leads.</p>
<p>Vero is the one tool that can help you send all the emails you need <em>and</em> keep all your data in one place.</p>
<h2>4. You can use dynamic segmentation.</h2>
<p>Most email platforms have lists: groups that the business can use for broad targeting.</p>
<p>The problem with with lists is that <strong>they are static</strong>. Our segments, on the other hand, are dynamic. You&rsquo;ll never have to export a list as .CSV, re-arrange thousands of email addresses and re-upload them. We do all the work for you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say, for example, you are Twitter and you&rsquo;re creating an onboarding campaign. There are four steps new users must take to start using your platform:</p>
<ol><li>Sign up</li>
<li>Complete profile</li>
<li>Follow other users</li>
<li>Send their first tweet</li>
</ol><p>You can create dynamic segments to encourage people to take the next step. Once they do, they&rsquo;ll enter a new segment encouraging them to take another step forward.</p>
<p>A segment rule might look like these. It says: <em>Include users who have signed up but not completed their profile</em>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4897" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/vero-email-marketing/onboarding-email-marketing-segment/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?fit=1015%2C306&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1015,306" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="onboarding email marketing segment" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?fit=300%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?fit=1015%2C306&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4897" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png" alt="onboarding email marketing segment" width="1015" height="306" border="1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?w=1015&amp;ssl=1 1015w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?resize=300%2C90&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?resize=50%2C15&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/onboarding-email-marketing-segment.png?resize=75%2C23&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>You can setup automatic emails to these people and once they complete their profile, they&rsquo;ll be removed from the segment.</p>
<h2>5. You can use external attributes to personalize emails.</h2>
<p>External attributes give personalization a whole new meaning.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to insert data from a web server directly into your emails <em>as they are sent</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if you are sending a shopping cart abandonment email, you could use external attributes to include a list of other products in the same price range. See how <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/behavioral-email-ideas/">Target</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> do this.</p>

<p>You can use any data you want to personalize emails and because we don&rsquo;t pull it until the last second, you can always be sure the data is up-to-date.</p>
<p>Read more about our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/external-attributes/" target="_blank">external attributes feature here</a>.</p>
<h2>6. You can keep all your data in one place.</h2>
<p><a href="https://segment.com/" target="_blank">Segment</a> is one of our favorite tools.</p>
<p>Vero is one of a growing number of tools that needs inject a bit of code in your site to collect data. Segment users inject code <strong>once</strong> and then manage all their tools in Segment. So if you use Vero and MixPanel, you only need one code injection to make both work.</p>

<h2>7. You can send emails based on the recipients&rsquo; time zone.</h2>
<p>Vero&rsquo;s time zone tool means you can email your users at 9am <em>their time</em>, regardless of where they are in the world.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="556px"><img data-attachment-id="4900" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/vero-email-marketing/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?fit=556%2C232&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="556,232" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email marketing send in time zone" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?fit=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?fit=556%2C232&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4900" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png" alt="email marketing send in time zone" width="556" height="232" border="1" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?w=556&amp;ssl=1 556w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?resize=240%2C100&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?resize=50%2C21&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/email-marketing-send-in-time-zone.png?resize=75%2C31&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px"></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Australia&rsquo;s love affair with online shopping is a gift that keeps on giving. While more than a quarter of us shop online once a week, we&rsquo;re shunning overseas sites in growing numbers, preferring to spend our cash on domestic sites. Indeed, 79 percent of Australians who shop online mostly spend their cash on local websites.</p>
<p>Some online shoppers are explicitly seeking out local merchants to mitigate some of the risks, ensure friendly return policies and guarantee quality goods; for other shoppers, it&rsquo;s all about supporting local retailers.</p>
<p>This is great news for local merchants who are willing to capitalise on the preference for shopping locally.</p>
<p>Many emerging Australian startups are dedicated to making online shopping an easier process and are creating opportunities for businesses to bolster their sales. Here are five innovative ideas to consider in 2014.</p>
<p><span id="more-2454"></span></p>
<h2>1. Optimise Your Product Display</h2>
<p>Quicker than ever before, online shoppers are making decisions about what they like and don&rsquo;t like, switching across websites in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>By offering a 3D display of your digital range, Aussie e-commerce innovator <a href="http://thereitis.com/" target="_blank">Thereitis 3D Display</a> can visually engage shoppers and bring your items to life.</p>
<p>The Adelaide startup has created cutting-edge technology that uses our human ability to skim through images quickly and optimises keyword search, category and price filters to make shopping online even easier.</p>
<p>It works particularly well with mobile devices, where users tend to navigate the screen using touch instead of mouse clicks.</p>
<p>The technology allows customers to more comprehensively judge products before purchase. As an example, the 3D technology increased conversion rates for a pendant on gifts.com by seven times.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://thereitis.com/" target="_blank">Thereitis</a>, and watch the video below.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/22IJCF7YS8I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>2. Increase Trust Levels</h2>
<p>Imagine allowing your customers to touch your online products before paying for them, without risking broken or lost inventory.inventory.</p>
<p>Sydney startup <a href="http://www.touchpayments.com.au/" target="_blank">Touch Payments</a> promises that customers won&rsquo;t ever have to pay for a product they haven&rsquo;t touched &acirc;&#128;&#148; a major bonus for promoting the concept of secure online shopping.</p>
<p>When shoppers choose Touch Payments at checkout, there are no credit card details to enter (no extra forms to fill out, no traditional credit checks) and nothing to pay at the time of purchase. Instead, customers are invoiced for their orders and receive their merchandise before having to make a payment.</p>
<p>Once an order ships, shoppers have up to 16 days (no interest or other fees) to pay the invoice through any of the following payment options: BPAY, bank transfer, credit card, debit card or even cash at Australia Post. Touch Payments assumes the risk, which means Touch always pays the merchant, no matter what.</p>
<p>By mitigating risk and offering quality assurance to even the most sceptical browsers, Touch Payments offers an increased trust level and a greater conversion rate for your shop. Delayed payment has increased conversion rates by up to 30 percent overseas.</p>
<p>As the first startup of its kind in Australia, Touch wants to show you how you can benefit. Get in <a href="http://www.touchpayments.com.au/" target="_blank">Touch</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Reinvent Delivery</h2>
<p>In a market obsessed with speedy delivery times, consumers expect their purchases to arrive almost instantly. This year, market-savvy merchants will enhance their sites with <a href="http://parcelpoint.com.au/" target="_blank">ParcelPoint</a>, a solution that addresses the problem of missed deliveries.</p>
<p>ParcelPoint partners with couriers to allow consumers to direct their parcels to a nearby shop within a network of stores, from news agents to convenience stores, which will hold a parcel until the customer is ready to collect it, seven days a week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a convenient solution for people who don&rsquo;t want purchases delivered to their homes or work or who are unavailable during regular 9-5 delivery times.</p>
<p>Some retail partners only use the service to facilitate fast returns, because returns don&rsquo;t require changes to the retailer&rsquo;s e-management system.</p>
<p>ParcelPoint has over 1,000 pick-up locations and is worth investigating as a way to provide more convenience to your customers.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://parcelpoint.com.au/" target="_blank">ParcelPoint</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Introduce Alternative Payment Options</h2>
<p>Melbourne startup <a href="https://www.coinjar.com/" target="_blank">CoinJar</a> is another newcomer that is shaking things up in the e-commerce space.</p>
<p>In response to the recent boom in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> transactions, CoinJar&rsquo;s young founders identified a gap in the market for an easy-to-use digital wallet for buying, selling and accept bitcoin as a merchant. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that avoids having to pay bank fees and absorb exchange-rate losses.</p>
<p>With more than 20,000 Aussie users, both Bitcoin and CoinJar make it easier to purchase goods online.</p>
<p>CoinJar eases the way for merchants to start accepting bitcoin payments and offers solutions that allow buyers to use the currency. It&rsquo;s cheaper than accepting credit card payment: The retailer&rsquo;s fee is 1.1 percent per transaction.</p>
<p>Given that CoinJar offers complete security when making digital payments, these sorts of applications to your site could give Australians looking for alternatives to PayPal and other established methods a virtual nudge into the online world.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.coinjar.com/" target="_blank">CoinJar</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Use Social to Sell</h2>
<p>Finding customers where they already are is a massive advantage.</p>
<p>U.S. startup <a href="http://new.soldsie.com/landing/" target="_blank">Soldsie</a> allows you to sell directly, via social media. By simply commenting on a picture posted on your fan page, your customer has the opportunity to order straight from your online shop by logging on to Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Soldsie manages the process and makes it simple so that merchants wanting to take the headache out of selling on social media can focus on existing e-commerce channels and directly monetise social media followers.</p>
<p>Best of all, Soldsie now treats spam comments as regular comments, meaning they will be parsed without any additional work on your part.</p>
<p>Comments create conversion rates of four times more than links, and Soldsie claims that use of Soldsie has increased sales by a whopping 300 percent for its merchant partners.</p>

<html><body><p>Does writing an email subject line make you sweat?</p>
<p>Knowing it can make or break your email campaign sure puts on the pressure, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to make it easier for you to write a winning email subject line. I&rsquo;m going to share research findings about high-converting email subject lines &mdash; the ones that get the email opened and read.</p>
<p>Researchers have tested at least four elements:</p>
<ul><li>The use specific words</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Length</li>
<li>Reader connection</li>
</ul><p>Read on to learn how email campaigns can be affected by these elements and how you can use them to get better results.</p>
<p><span id="more-2444"></span></p>
<h3 id="1.-use-words-that-trigger-email-opens-and-clicks.">1. Use words that trigger email opens and clicks.</h3>
<p>Words are the building blocks of your email subject lines. Single words can trigger images, emotions, attitudes and memories. Words are powerful.</p>
<p>Are some words more likely than others to get your subject lines opened?</p>
<p>Research suggests exactly that.</p>
<p>In 2013, <a href="http://www.adestra.com/resources/downloadable-reports/2013-subject-line-analysis-report/">Adestra</a> released a study of email subject lines from 2.2 billion emails in an attempt to identify specific words and phrases that get both higher open rates and higher click rates.</p>
<p>The study covered various sectors, including B2B, B2C, nonprofit, retail and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Across all sectors, the email subject lines with the following words and phrases had open and click rates that were higher than average:</p>
<ul><li>Free delivery</li>
<li>Sale</li>
<li>Alert</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Win</li>
<li>Daily</li>
<li>Weekly</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, benefit-oriented words like &ldquo;free delivery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sale&rdquo; do well in email subject lines. Words conveying urgency or time sensitivity also get emails opened. The success of &ldquo;video&rdquo; in email subject lines is probably due to the increasing popularity of online videos; more and more people are viewing them.</p>
<p>In contrast, some words in email subject lines tend to lower open and click rates:</p>
<ul><li>Free</li>
<li>Only</li>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Report</li>
<li>Today</li>
<li>Webinar</li>
<li>Monthly</li>
<li>Get</li>
<li>Register</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t miss</li>
<li>Re:</li>
<li>Fw:</li>
</ul><p>The low performance of these words suggests email users have gotten smart about identifying hype. Some of these words have become overused in spam, especially &ldquo;free,&rdquo; &ldquo;Re:&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that call-to-action words, such as &ldquo;get&rdquo; and &ldquo;register,&rdquo; generally did poorly in email subject lines.</p>
<p>Benefit-oriented words, provided they&rsquo;re not hype-y, do better in email subject lines than calls to action.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights of the study</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="479" height="3270" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/24648211" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="4 steps to writing a killer subject line" href="https://www.slideshare.net/adestra/ade-006-infographicsubjectlinereportv420130620" target="_blank">4 steps to writing a killer subject line</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adestra" target="_blank">Adestra Ltd.</a></strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Adestra study presents different findings for specific sectors, so it would be worth your while to get the full study to learn about sector-specific findings relevant to you.</p>
<p>In another study, words referring to movies and songs appear to lift email open rates.</p>
<p>In an analysis of 3.7 million emails, <a href="http://www.retentionscience.com/new-research-reveals-which-email-subject-lines-perform-best-for-marketers/">Retention Science</a> found that subject lines with a movie title or a song lyric have an average open rate of 26 percent compared with only 15.8 percent for subject lines without these cultural references.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s relevant, and when you think it will resonate with your readers, mentioning a movie or a song in your subject line will probably get your email opened.</p>
<h3 id="2.-personalize.">2. Personalize.</h3>
<p>In <em>&ldquo;How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People,&rdquo;</em> Dale Carnegie says &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does personalizing with the reader&rsquo;s name make email subject lines more effective?</p>
<p>Research says the answer is yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.retentionscience.com/new-research-reveals-which-email-subject-lines-perform-best-for-marketers/">Retention Science</a> analyzed 260 million emails and 540 campaigns and found that personalization did increase email open rates. Subject lines with the recipient&rsquo;s first name had an average open rate of 18.3 percent, while subject lines without a first name had an average open rate of 15.7 percent.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://www.mailermailer.com/resources/metrics/2013/personalization.rwp">MailerMailer</a> found personalized subject lines had an average open rate of 12.9 percent compared with 9.8 percent for subject lines without personalization.</p>
<p>Still not convinced? In yet another study, <a href="http://www.experian.com/marketing-services/email-market-study-2013.html">Experian</a> found personalized subject lines had 26 percent higher open rates than nonpersonalized ones. The lift was highest for travel companies.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, Experian found that 70 percent of brands do not personalize their emails. If your practices mirror those brands, personalization is an element you should definitely look at.</p>
<h3 id="3.-keep-the-subject-line-either-very-short----or-very-long.">3. Keep the subject line either very short &mdash; or very long.</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the length of your subject line. Can it make a difference?</p>
<p>According to Retention Science, email subject lines with six to 10 words had the highest open rate (21 percent), followed by subject lines with five or fewer words (16 percent). Subject lines with more than 10 words performed worse as they got longer.</p>
<p>A number of other studies had similar results. For Return Path, the sweet spot was less than 49 characters (12.5 percent higher open rates and 75 percent higher click-through rates).</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.adestra.com/true-false-shorter-subject-lines-will-give-better-results/">Adestra</a>, however, the effect of email subject-line length on open and click rates wasn&rsquo;t as straightforward.</p>
<p>Adestra found that email subject lines had to be either very short (less than 30 characters) or very long (100 characters and longer) for open, click-through and click-to-open rates to be optimized.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/13341?token=IJGISsPwj_Eh4M2p4wljXrUaj5lWGYWcux4nHo07AbWtv_PwFDC0N44L0CzMofnF3yEofWsJZRZTpNhsyRSeANk"></p>
<p>While this finding may support longer email subject lines, keep in mind how many of your subscribers access emails on mobile devices. As we mentioned (<a href="http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/subject-line-strategie-that-increase-your-open-rates/">http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/subject-line-strategie-that-increase-your-open-rates/</a>), because mobile devices truncate email subject lines, you need to consider length and word order.</p>
<h3 id="4.-connect-with-your-reader.">4. Connect with your reader.</h3>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at general principles that work when writing subject lines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/email-optimization/subject-lines-that-convert.html">Marketing Experiments</a> studied over 100 successful email subject lines and concluded that they worked because they built an immediate connection with the readers.</p>
<p>You can create this immediate connection through one of two approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Connect to an internal issue</strong></p>
<p>By &ldquo;internal issue,&rdquo; Marketing Experiments is referring to a need or a problem your readers have.</p>
<p>Examples of internal issues include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of resources, such as time, money or help</li>
<li>Unmet expectations, whether at work or in the family</li>
<li>Inability or inadequacy of skills</li>
<li>Operational difficulties, such as lack of usability</li>
<li>Fragmented perspectives, such as ignorance or misunderstanding</li>
</ul><p>When your subject line promises a relief or a solution to any of these issues, your email will get opened and get a higher click rate.</p>
<p>For instance, the following subject lines outperformed similar ones that didn&rsquo;t connect with an internal issue:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;[Company Name]: Now only 2-meal minimum order&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Free Unlimited Access to [Newspaper] Online&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Reach 120,000 Physicians Through Social Media&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Connect to an external event</strong></p>
<p>External events are activities, whether in the recent or distant past, which have occurred in your subscribers&rsquo; lives. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Action or behavior</li>
<li>Conversation</li>
<li>Single exchange (completed or abandoned order)</li>
<li>Cancellation (of a membership, contract or recurring transactio)</li>
<li>Service interaction</li>
</ul><p>Subject lines referring to such external events make the emails more meaningful to the recipient. These emails become part of a subscriber&rsquo;s &ldquo;story.&rdquo; As a result, the emails are opened more and get higher click rates as well.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of subject lines that connect to an external event:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;[Name], Your Account Information Is Ready to View&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Did you forget your [Bank Name] online username or password?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Subject lines that fail &ndash; Recent research reveals why your emails don&rsquo;t get opened&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>These subject lines work, because they connect with your readers&rsquo; lives. This shows the power of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features">crafting targeted email campaigns</a> and subject lines based on subscribers&rsquo; actions.</p>
<p>Here are highlights from the study</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="427" height="356" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28490901" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="Subject Lines that Convert: A review of 100+ successful subject lines reveals what motivates people to open (or delete) an email" href="https://www.slideshare.net/marketingexperiments/webclinic-subject-lines-nov-2013-v5jp-eh-slideshare" target="_blank">Subject Lines that Convert: A review of 100+ successful subject lines reveals what motivates people to open (or delete) an email</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/marketingexperiments" target="_blank">MarketingExperiments:</a></strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="putting-everything-together">Putting Everything Together</h3>
<p>These research findings give you a starting point for writing email subject lines that are most likely to work with your subscribers. Use the research to form hypotheses about the types of subject lines that may get higher opens and click rates.</p>
<p>These are not hard-and-fast rules.</p>
<p>Take into account that these studies were conducted in different sectors and markets, and even with different types of mailing lists &mdash; current customers, prospects, lapsed subscribers, etc.</p>
<p>The best way to discover what will work with your readers is to test. For inspiration, here are some examples of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-ab-split-test-tricks-so-good-youll-kick-yourself-youve-been-missing-out/">A/B split tests of email subject lines</a>.</p>
<p>And when you test, realize it&rsquo;s not enough to look at open rates; you must also look at click rates. You&rsquo;re not after hype-filled subject lines that get opened out of curiosity but are then quickly abandoned because they&rsquo;re irrelevant. Align subject lines with the content of the email to drive click-throughs.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with recent research on email subject lines, how do you plan to improve the subject lines you write? Which elements are you going to test in your campaigns?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Email receipts are the easiest way into an inbox, yet they&rsquo;re the most underutilized form of email marketing.</p>
<p>If you own a brick-and-mortar store, why would you pay for paper that you know customers will throw away or lose? A digital copy, delivered straight to the inbox, is environmentally friendly, easy to find and perfect for a subtle call to action. Email receipts are more convenient and less expensive and are likely <strong>the future of email marketing</strong>.</p>
<p>For online services and businesses, email receipts are a necessity, but they should also be used for marketing. Just a few years ago, businesses thought of customer service as a cost center; today, customer service is at the heart of the marketing plans developed by most successful businesses. In the same way, <strong>email receipts are an opportunity for growth hacking</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-6752"></span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder and Square CEO, called receipts the next publishing medium. I&rsquo;m not sure receipts are the cure for the demise of print media, but I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/jack-dorsey-says-the-receipt-is-untapped-canvas-and-publishi">BuzzFeed</a> reported on Dorsey&rsquo;s comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What if we see the receipt more as a publishing medium &ndash; a product unto itself that people actually want to take home, that they want to engage with, be fully interactive with?&rdquo; Dorsey asked a room of people at the Javits Center today during the National Retail Federation&rsquo;s annual expo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do with this everyday tool?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can we build into this canvas that&rsquo;s actually valuable, that&rsquo;s independent of the product you just sold? What can you give in this communication channel, this publishing medium, that people want to engage with?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Dorsey is right: Receipts are a missed opportunity. People want them. People need them. Email receipts are a win-win for consumers and businesses. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some missed opportunities and then check out a few savvy marketers who are already onto this trend.</p>
<h2>Email Receipts: A Sad Tale of Missed Opportunities</h2>
<p>A few months ago, I bought a restaurant gift card for a family member&rsquo;s birthday. I made the transaction online and received this email receipt. It&rsquo;s functional &ndash; if I need a record of the transaction, this works &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also a huge missed opportunity.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="619px"><img class="size-full wp-image-2391 alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/uncle-julios-receipt.png" alt="uncle-julios-receipt" width="619" height="795"></p>
<p>Here are a few ways this email could have resulted in a little extra revenue for the restaurant.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Included calls to action.</strong> This email is about as bare as they come. Why not include links to the restaurant&rsquo;s Facebook and Twitter pages? Why not offer me $5 off my next meal if I sign up to receive regular emails? I mean, at least let me know what this week&rsquo;s happy-hour deals are!</li>
<li><strong>Partnered up with another store.</strong> If you sell gift cards on your website, you know people give them as gifts (duh). The people who buy gift cards might need another gift, too. Why not partner up with other businesses in your area to help each other grow? For example, there is a great coffee shop near this restaurant. The restaurant could share a coupon to the coffee shop, and the coffee shop could let people know about the great Mexican restaurant down the road. It&rsquo;s unconventional, but it could be a very effective way to earn new business.</li>
<li><strong>Shown me food porn.</strong> I found the photo below on the restaurant&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unclejulios">Facebook page</a>. Why was this not in the email? It makes me hungry, which makes me want to eat there!</li>
</ul><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2394" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/food-porn-email-marketing.jpg" alt="food porn email marketing" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>This restaurant had my permission to email me but missed out on free revenue-generating advertising. Because of constrained resources, small businesses sometimes struggle with marketing. The next example, however, is inexcusable.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right: Apple.</p>

<p>I dug through my iTunes receipts and learned two things:</p>
<ol><li>I buy too many apps.</li>
<li>Apple sometimes includes marketing on receipts, but not always.</li>
</ol><p>Apple has the luxury of data: The company knows <em>everything</em> about me. Some of its emails use the common (and very effective) &ldquo;If you bought this, you might like this &hellip;&rdquo; call to action. Apple doesn&rsquo;t do coupons, so this approach would have made perfect sense. The company gets 30 percent of every app sale, so it would makes sense to promote other apps in the same category. Here are a few other things that could have been done:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Pointed me to a retail location.</strong> Since Apple has my address, why not take the opportunity to let me know where the nearest Apple store is? Most locations offer free classes, sell loads of Apple accessories, offer device-recycling programs and let customers play with the newest gadgets.</li>
<li><strong>Inspired me.</strong> Apple&rsquo;s advertisements have taken a nostalgic turn recently. <a href="http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/">Videos like this one</a> attract a lot of attention from the technology crowd, but email receipts would be the perfect way to engage the rest of Apple&rsquo;s customer base.</li>
<li><strong>Offered partner ads.</strong> What if Apple&rsquo;s email receipts actually offered ad space to developers? Many apps offer in-app upgrades; this would be the perfect place to introduce new users to those premium features.</li>
</ul><p>These ideas are low-hanging fruit for any business, even for brick-and-mortar stores that don&rsquo;t currently offer email receipts.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a look at a few companies that use email receipts to their advantage.</p>
<h2>Growth Hacking with Email Receipts</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an email receipt I got from Uber recently.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2396" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/uber-receipt.png" alt="uber-receipt" width="682" height="800"></p>
<p>Uber killed it. And it&rsquo;s not surprising, coming from an innovative company that has growth-hacked its way to enormous success. Here is an incredible stat from the <a href="http://blog.uber.com/2011/09/22/chicago-ubers-biggest-launch-to-date/">Uber blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Uber spends virtually zero dollars on marketing, spreading almost exclusively via word of mouth. I&rsquo;m talking old school word of mouth, you know at the water cooler in the office, at a restaurant when you&rsquo;re paying the bill, at a party with friends &ndash; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Ubering home?&rdquo; 95% of all our riders have heard about Uber from other Uber riders. Our virality is almost unprecedented. <strong>For every 7 rides we do, our users&rsquo; big mouths generate a new rider.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Uber understands that the experience is what drives word-of-mouth marketing, but a $20 referral turns many Uber customers into salespeople. It&rsquo;s a beautifully subtle and effective way to use email receipts for growth hacking. And it&rsquo;s working really, really well. (Some people are actually <a href="http://pando.com/2014/01/22/hacking-startup-referral-programs-for-fun-and-profit/">running Facebook ads on their own dime to generate Uber referrals</a>!)</p>
<p>LivingSocial includes a referral call to action in its emails as well. The company also promotes its mobile app, which is another important marketing tool.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="613px"><img data-attachment-id="2397" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/living-social-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?fit=613%2C359&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="613,359" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="living-social-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?fit=613%2C359&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2397" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png" alt="living-social-email-marketing" width="613" height="359" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?w=613&amp;ssl=1 613w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?resize=171%2C100&amp;ssl=1 171w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?resize=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/living-social-email-marketing.png?resize=75%2C44&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px"></p>
<p>SkillShare takes a similar approach.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="609px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2398" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/skillshare-receipt.png" alt="skillshare-receipt" width="609" height="631"></p>
<p>And Active.com goes BIG on email receipts. This is probably overkill, but no stone is being left unturned in the quest to grow.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="615px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2399" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/active-receipt.png" alt="active-receipt" width="615" height="2236"></p>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, I came across a post on the Moz blog about creating &ldquo;<a href="http://moz.com/blog/5-strategic-steps-to-big-content" target="_blank">big content</a>.&rdquo; It was witty, insightful and impressively thorough. By the time I reached the end of the article, I was hungry for more.</p>
<p>It turns out that the author, one Mackenzie Fogelson, is also the founder and CEO of a community and brand building company called <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/" target="_blank">Mack Web</a>. The implications of trust-based, relationship-focused, customer-centric community management for email marketers cannot be overstated. We knew Mackenzie could even teach email pros a thing or two about<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/the-elusive-inbox/"> earning their way into an inbox</a>, so we asked her to share her knowledge here on the Vero blog. Luckily, she agreed. We picked her brain about email, the nuts and bolts of community building and the future of marketing, and we learned a lot in the process.</p>

<h2>Are marketing and community building the same thing?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> I very much think of community building as marketing, but I may have a different approach to marketing than most people. To me, community building as marketing isn&rsquo;t a tactic. <strong>It&rsquo;s a lifestyle change.</strong></p>
<p>When you commit to your customers &ndash; which is required to build a vibrant community &ndash; your marketing becomes an exercise in awareness. You can&rsquo;t just tell the story of your company, products and services. You have to live and breathe your company values, all day, every day, online and offline. In other words, don&rsquo;t explain why you&rsquo;re different (and better) than your competitors &ndash; show it.</p>
<p>When you take the community building approach to marketing your business, the whole company undergoes a transformation, from the inside out. You start with your end goals in mind and work backwards to determine strategy, execution, and measurement. You collaboratively work with internal and external teams to integrate all of your communication channels: content, social media, search, email, and even offline efforts such as events and face-to-face exchanges. It&rsquo;s the integration of all of these channels that allows you to present a meaningful experience to those who interact with your brand &ndash; and community &ndash; no matter where they are.</p>
<p>Community building as marketing places the focus on relationships. You&rsquo;ve got to use both quantitative and qualitative data to guide your efforts, but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about how you&rsquo;re connecting with people. It&rsquo;s important that you not only solicit feedback, but take it very seriously.</p>
<p>It can be hard to hear the truth from your customers and employees, but when you are brave enough to do something about it, people recognize the authenticity and transparency. Using community building as marketing is a powerful thing, but it requires a tireless commitment and genuine passion. It&rsquo;s certainly not for everyone.</p>
<h2>How has the marketing changed over the last few years?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> I definitely see an evolution happening with companies wanting more from their marketing. Companies who are seeking to communicate the meaning and purpose in what they do on a different level. They want to connect with their customers and they know that this isn&rsquo;t done by broadcasting a self-promotional message. It&rsquo;s those companies who want to contribute to the lives of their customers, and live their values and mission, who are the best fit for using community building in their marketing as they are up for the challenge of transforming their businesses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing more and more of these companies come forward and it&rsquo;s really exciting to see the momentum for this type of marketing build.</p>
<h2>You do this for clients, but how does Mack Web build and maintain relationships for itself?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> Communication is key. But staying connected to people is a lot of work, especially when you&rsquo;re not a &acirc;&#128;&#156;local&acirc;&#128;&#157; company. Only one of our clients is here in Fort Collins, so the distance can sometimes cause gaps not only in communication but in the strength of the relationship. So it&rsquo;s something that we work very hard at and inherently build into everything we do (it&rsquo;s also a big part of what I love to do here at Mack Web).</p>
<p>For as much time as we spend online, we make an effort to match it offline. I love the face-to-face so I travel several times a year to speak at conferences and meet with our clients. When we cannot be face-to-face, we meet with our clients on Google+ hangouts instead of conference calls. It helps to close the distance gap, keep things more personal, and get more done.</p>
<p>There is a lot of overlap in communication and marketing. This is where community management really gets fun. We use content a great deal to maintain relationships with current and future customers. I blog often because I love to teach and share knowledge. It allows me to do that and stay connected to all the different communities in our industry.</p>
<p>We are very committed to our own blog as well. Even with a small team, we are creating a useful resource for our community of readers each week. We just started producing <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/category/nuggets-of-knowledge/" target="_blank">Nuggets of Knowledge</a>, also known as the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NOKlist&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#NOKlist</a>. It&rsquo;s a list of curated resources by our team, for our readers. It&rsquo;s a great way for us to connect by sharing other people&rsquo;s knowledge and it also gives our readers a chance to get to know our team&rsquo;s prowess and personality.</p>
<p>We also use email marketing to keep in touch. We send an email each week to let readers know what&rsquo;s happening on the blog. And obviously we&rsquo;re on social media a lot, both individually (I love <a href="https://twitter.com/mackfogelson" target="_blank">Twitter</a>) but also as a company. But even though our company is small, we have a dedicated social media and community manager that is continuously looking for ways to reach out and connect online.</p>
<p>Even with all these amazing tools at our disposal, nothing beats having a coffee with someone. That&rsquo;s still my favorite.</p>
<h2>Where does email fit into the community building process at Mack Web?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> Email is such an important tool for us and for our clients. Just as you must earn trust on social media to build your community, you&rsquo;ve got to do the same with email (and any other channel you use). If you can earn trust by offering your readers and customers great information, they&rsquo;ll look forward to your emails (and stay on your list). That&rsquo;s the approach we take and it&rsquo;s been extremely effective.</p>
<p>In addition to blog updates, we use email to keep our readers informed about the growth of the company and trends in the integrated marketing and community building space. We also have some drip campaigns coming up as an extension of our community building guide (more on that in a minute) which we&rsquo;re really excited about.</p>
<p>We find that it&rsquo;s really important to think of email marketing as a two-way conversation. Just because someone gives you their email address doesn&rsquo;t mean they want you to broadcast your sales pitches at them all the time. You have to remember that it&rsquo;s easy to lose the trust you&rsquo;ve spent so much time and effort building. Every email counts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great about email marketing is that we can use analytics as a barometer. We use A/B testing on our subject lines and are constantly analyzing the data to provide our readers with what they want. Similar to how we approach community building, we are sending emails to people, not email addresses, so we make a huge effort to provide information that&rsquo;s relevant and useful.</p>
<h2>What are a few great resources for marketers interested in community management?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> We recently published a 147-page e-book &ndash; <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/guide-to-building-online-communities/"><em>The Truly Monumental Guide to Building Online Communities</em></a> &ndash; which I&rsquo;d definitely recommend checking out. We did a webinar as a follow-up to this and made the <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/2014/01/essentials-of-community-building/">slides available here</a>.</p>
<p>There are several other books and resources that I&rsquo;d recommend:</p>
<ul><li>Carrie Melissa Jones always has great stuff to read about community on her blog: <a href="http://carriemelissa.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">carriemelissa.wordpress.com</a></li>
<li>The Moz blog always has great stuff on it. For community-specific stuff, you can <a href="http://moz.com/community/users/81197" target="_blank">check out Jen&rsquo;s posts here</a>. There&rsquo;s also a whole <a href="ttp://moz.com/community/users/233927" target="_blank">community building series</a> on Moz available within the posts I&rsquo;ve written there.</li>
<li>I think Wistia does an amazing job of building their community. I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/wistia">following them on Twitter</a> to observe how they connect with their community.</li>
<li>Marty Weintraub and Lauren Litwinka wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Social-Media-Community-Managers/dp/1118466853" target="_blank"><em>The Complete Social Media Community Manager&rsquo;s Guide</em></a>, which is a fantastic resource.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m reading a book right now that seems like it will have some great stuff in it. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.brainsonfire.com/books/brainsonfire.html" target="_blank"><em>Brains on Fire</em></a>, and it&rsquo;s all about sustainability in your marketing (which is what we&rsquo;re all about).</li>
</ul><p>Check out the <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/blog/" target="_blank">Mack Web blog</a> to learn more.</p></body></html>

<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://conversionxl.com/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/peep-laja.jpg" alt="">ConversionXL</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/peeplaja" target="_blank">@peeplaja</a></h2>

<p>Brian Clark has built a multimillion dollar technology company with the Copyblogger blog. He is essentially selling pickaxes &ndash; hosting, WordPress plugins, education, etc. &ndash; during a gold rush. The business model and the blog are both worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>Crazy Egg&rsquo;s heat maps and click-tracking overlays are incredibly useful. It turns out their blog, The Daily Egg, is also a great resource. While the tools are designed to provide data, the blog offers training, tips and insight on conversion and engagement.</p>

<p>Every writer needs inspiration. I often get mine from Jeff Goins. <a href="http://goinswriter.com/turn-pro/" target="_blank">See below</a>, and subscribe for daily encouragement.</p>
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s an important truth that few people who&rsquo;ve &ldquo;made it&rdquo; in their industry want to talk about. But in my experience, it&rsquo;s essential to success.</p>
<p>What is it? Mindset.</p>
<p>Success is first experienced in the mind before it becomes a reality. This may sound kind of metaphysical, but all I mean is: Before you start acting like a pro, you will have to think like a pro.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Growth Hackers isn&rsquo;t technically a blog &ndash; it&rsquo;s a community &ndash; it is a fantastic resource for marketers. Users can submit and vote on content, meaning the best and most interesting stuff is always at the top.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Groove-HQ.png" alt="">Groove</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmturnbull" target="_blank">@alexmturnbull</a></h2>

<p>Freelancing has become an industry of its own. Now that people can work anywhere, anytime, companies looking to invest in content marketing can essentially buy Content as a Service. It&rsquo;s a great model, but freelancers often lack the business skills to maximize their earning potential. This blog solves that issue.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="https://www.helpscout.net/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/help-scout.png" alt="">Help Scout</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/helpscout" target="_blank">@helpscout</a></h2>
<p>Customer support = marketing. (<a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/zappos-art-of-culture/" target="_blank">Just ask Zappos.</a>) Help Scout knows a thing or two about customer support, and their blog shows other companies how to turn support into sales.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hubspot.jpg" alt="">HubSpot</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/HubSpot" target="_blank">@hubspot</a></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how seriously HubSpot takes content marketing: They hired rock star journalist <a href="http://contentscience.org/2014/02/journalism-content-marketing-collide/" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a> to run their blog. This is a media platform, loaded with content on all things inbound marketing.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://inbound.org/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/inbound-org.png" alt="">Inbound.org</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/Inboundorg" target="_blank">@inboundorg</a></h2>
<p>In the same vein as Growth Hackers, Inbound.org isn&rsquo;t technically a blog. It was co-founded by the fine folks at Moz and Hubspot, and has grown into a flourishing community of marketers sharing the best content they can find.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://insideintercom.io/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/intercom-io.jpg" alt="">Inside Intercom</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/intercom" target="_blank">@intercom</a></h2>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if your blog got 4 million visitors each year? Jeff Bullas&rsquo; does. He writers about the content, SEO and social media strategies he uses to make it happen.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://joel.is/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/joel-gascoigne.png" alt="">Joel Gascoigne</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/joelgascoigne" target="_blank">@joelgascoigne</a></h2>
<p>This blog leans more toward entrepreneurship and startup life than strict marketing, but it&rsquo;s too good not to include. Learn what the co-founder of Buffer is thinking, and get an idea of what life is like as the head of a rapidly growing startup.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/kiss-metrics.jpg" alt="">KISSmetrics</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/kissmetrics" target="_blank">@kissmetrics</a></h2>

<p>The Mack Web Solutions blog is a breath of fresh air in the noisy world of blogging. This blog (and company) focuses on community building, which means there is no fluff. If it&rsquo;s not useful, you won&rsquo;t find it on this blog. (Read our interview with founder and CEO <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-and-community-management/">Mackenzie Fogelson</a> here.)</p>

<p>With 23 categories of content to choose from, you could spend hours a day reading MarketingProfs. And that doesn&rsquo;t take into account the podcast, in-depth marketing guides and video tutorials.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://blog.marketo.com/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/marketo.jpg" alt="">Marketo</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/marketo" target="_blank">@marketo</a></h2>
<p>Automation and data are the two overriding themes of the Marketo blog. With a healthy emphasis on email, this blog gets at the heart of modern marketing. Automation will continue to be more important in marketing, so start digging in now.</p>

<p>Since journalism and marketing are converging at an alarming rate, it&rsquo;s worth seeing what you can learn from journalists. Run by Harvard University, the Nieman Journalism Lab explores &ldquo;how quality journalism can survive and thrive in the Internet age.&rdquo; Their goals are essentially the same as yours, so pay attention to this one.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://okdork.com/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ok-dork.png" alt="">Noah Kagan&rsquo;s Okdork</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/noahkagan" target="_blank">@noahkagan</a></h2>

<p>Lee Odden has been blogging about online marketing since the Google Florida update. (I&rsquo;d never heard of it either; it happened in 2003.) He&rsquo;s built up impressive reservoir of content and a great community over the past 11 years. The new stuff is great, and the <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2003/12/" target="_blank">old stuff</a> is worth checking out too.</p>
<h2 class=" small-image" style="px"><a href="http://unbounce.com/blog/" target="_blank"><img style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; height: 100px; width: 100px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unbounce.png" alt="">Unbounce</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/unbounce" target="_blank">@unbounce</a></h2>

<p>Video marketing is often neglected by startup marketers because of the high cost of professional video. The Wistia blog, however, explains why video is worth the investment and offers tips on video best practices. One of our favorites: <a href="http://wistia.com/blog/embedding-video-in-email" target="_blank">Should You Embed Video in Email?</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Did you know that Lego has been marketing content since 1987?</p>
<p>That Red Bull sends its <em>Red Bulletin</em> magazine to over 5 million subscribers?</p>
<p>That John Deere runs the largest farming magazine worldwide, and it&rsquo;s been in circulation since <em>1895</em>?</p>
<p>Content marketing is hugely popular in 2014. Particularly popular among B2B marketing-software companies, content marketing is a powerful way to attract super-targeted customers who want to buy in your space.</p>
<p>Some argue about whether it can work in other verticals or for other online industries.</p>
<p>The answer is that whether you&rsquo;re in e-commerce, B2C software or something even crazier, these ideas should give you some inspiration for how you can put <strong>epic content marketing to work for you</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2140"></span></p>
<h2 id="entertain-your-audience">Entertain your audience</h2>
<p>If you were 10 years old, how would a magazine <em>&acirc;&#128;&#157;full of comic adventures, games and puzzles, building challenges and cool creations&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> sound?</p>
<p>Entertaining, that&rsquo;s how!</p>
<p>The above quote is Lego&rsquo;s description of its <strong>free</strong> Lego Club magazine (<a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/join" target="_blank">sign up if you want</a>; I&rsquo;m tempted).</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="390px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2156" alt="lego-club-magazine" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lego-club-magazine.jpg" width="390" height="510"></p>
<p>Lego is about imagination. It&rsquo;s a way to teach children that they can be creative and to test their imaginative limits. If you can dream it, then you can build it with Legos. The magazine, which targets the primary users of the company&rsquo;s product, gives kids ideas &mdash; in the form of comics and games and, even more directly, in the form of creations &mdash; that they can implement.</p>
<p>There is <strong>always</strong> a new Lego product. By inspiring its young target market, Lego is ensuring there will always be children asking their parents for the latest fire truck!</p>
<p>Entertainment is certainly one way to approach content marketing. It is essential that you understand your audience. Recently, <em>The Tonight Show</em> has been using entertaining online content to draw a growing audience. Jimmy Fallon&rsquo;s celebrity guests, outrageous skits and willingness to take it up a notch have shown how powerful entertaining content can be (even when advertising an entertainment show!).</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZTpn30Pms8I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For a more recent example, look no further than President Obama&rsquo;s feature on <em>Between Two Ferns</em>. Love or hate it, it was a sensational example of entertainment content to promote a particular objective (the Affordable Care Act in this case).</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="640" height="400" src="http://www.funnyordie.com/embed/18e820ec3f" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<div style="text-align: left; font-size: x-small; margin-top: 0; width: 640px;" class=" aspect-ratio"><a title="from President Barack Obama, Zach Galifianakis, Scott Aukerman, BJPorter, Funny Or Die, Between Two Ferns, rachelgoldenberg, Brian Lane, Aaron Ulrich, and BoTown Sound" href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/18e820ec3f/between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis-president-barack-obama">Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis: President Barack Obama</a> from <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/president_barack_obama">President Barack Obama</a> <iframe width="320" height="240" style="border: none; overflow: hidden; width: 90px; height: 21px; vertical-align: middle;" src="http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=138711277798&amp;href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.funnyordie.com%2Fvideos%2F18e820ec3f%2Fbetween-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis-president-barack-obama&amp;send=false&amp;layout=button_count&amp;width=150&amp;show_faces=false&amp;action=like&amp;height=21" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the best B2B example that comes to mind is <a href="http://wistia.com/" target="_blank">Wistia</a>. The documentation and feature videos are nothing but pure fun. Wistia makes you want to be a part of its zany and growing world, and the company displays a consistent example of content marketing pointed to by so many great content marketers.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a video or a magazine. How can you incorporate some <strong>entertainment</strong> into your content marketing (or make that the feature of <strong>your</strong> content marketing) to engage viewers and drive purchases?</p>
<h2 id="inform-your-audience">Inform your audience</h2>
<p>John Deere&rsquo;s <em>The Furrow</em> is a 118-year-old magazine with a fascinating story.</p>
<p>A true example of content marketing, <em>The Furrow</em> started life as an advertorial magazine for John Deere tractors and farming equipment. Progressing through the archives, you can see that, relatively quickly, the magazine became a magazine that <strong>told stories</strong>, even when it dealt with John Deere products.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2167" alt="John Deere Content Marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/the-furrow1-640.png" width="640" height="424"></p>
<p>As David Jones (publications manager at <em>The Furrow</em>) points outs: &ldquo;Telling stories that folks enjoy reading &acirc;&#128;&#148; and that they can use in their own operations &acirc;&#128;&#148; has been the recipe since the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David couldn&rsquo;t have better summarized the point of content marketing. With a circulation of just under 2 million worldwide, <em>The Furrow</em> continues to be a powerful way for John Deere to do three things:</p>
<ol><li>Get new customers</li>
<li>Sell more products to longtime customers</li>
<li>Build loyalty and, in turn, referrals</li>
</ol><p><em>The Furrow</em> has risen to legendary status; it is a brand in its own right, and one with a fiercely loyal readership that still prefers the paper version over digital copy. Archival copies of the magazine regularly fetch amazing prices on auction sites.</p>
<p>Informing your audience by telling stories that share knowledge can just as easily work for you.</p>
<p>Neil Patel&rsquo;s Quick Sprout is a shining example of a business that consistently and clearly informs its audience with stories that matter.</p>

<p>The epic guides that Neil puts out regularly, such as <em><a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/the-advanced-guide-to-seo/" target="_blank">The Advanced Guide to SEO</a></em>, are a particularly good example of sharing in-depth information in a way that is accessible and interesting to the reader. Neil&rsquo;s audience is made up of startup entrepreneurs and online marketers. His content speaks directly to them, and his examples, always practical and transparent, are generally based on his own experiments.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2169" alt="Ultimate Guide to Successful Email Marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing-640.png" width="640" height="353"></p>
<p>We recently created <em><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-guide/">The Ultimate Guide to Email Marketing</a></em> here on the Vero blog, and it has been a roaring success. The guide has garnered more than 1,000 social media shares and helped push our traffic to new heights &mdash; a fine example of how truly educational and informative content pays dividends.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2170" alt="Vero Traffic Growth" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/growth-640.png" width="640" height="126"><br><em>What you sow, so shall you reap?</em></p>
<p>You might not have guessed that telling stories about tractors could build such a loyal following, but understanding your target market and consistently giving them practical, influential advice is a surefire way to build trust and loyalty. It&rsquo;s also a surefire way to build a customer base.</p>
<h2 id="build-a-community">Build a community</h2>
<p>American Express, the credit card company, runs one of the largest and most interesting small-business marketing forums in the world.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2171" alt="american-express-forum-640" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/american-express-forum-640.png" width="640" height="399"></p>
<p>You may not have heard of the forum, but it accounts for as many new credit card inquiries as any other marketing channel that American Express uses &mdash; even those fancy television ads!</p>
<p>The trick? A loyal community. One of the great things about building a community is that, if done right, it can take on a life of its own. The American Express forum allows business owners and managers to share tips and tricks and to learn from others. It builds heavily on LinkedIn in a number of ways and is very much a place for relevant information for your business.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2172" alt="member-directory-amex1-640" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/member-directory-amex1-640.png" width="640" height="439"></p>
<p>Creating a community like this is hard work and requires a lot of time, but the results can be stellar.</p>
<p>Online, you can leverage whatever is most relevant to your audience. <a href="http://instagram.com/Soludos" target="_blank">Soludos</a>, maker of espadrilles, encourages its customers to share photos of themselves &mdash; usually wearing the espadrilles &mdash; on the company&rsquo;s Instagram page:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2173" alt="soludos-640" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/soludos-640.png" width="640" height="414"></p>
<p>Not only is Soludos engaging with its community, but the content is user-generated, which makes it easier for customers to relate and easier for Soludos to sustain.</p>
<p>Moz.com is the premier example from the world of B2B SaaS software. Moz&rsquo;s events and its user-generated blog, Mozinars, are all part of the company&rsquo;s community-driven approach to sharing useful SEO and online-marketing stories.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2174" alt="moz-640" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/moz-640.png" width="640" height="359"></p>
<p>One of the best examples is the Hacker News blog, run by YCombinator. Hacker News is certainly one contributing factor in positioning YC as perhaps the most successful and powerful incubator in the world. A haven for tech and startup discussion, it can, to this day, make or break stories and drive huge amounts of traffic to a website overnight &mdash; all without any direct influence from YC.</p>
<p>How can you shape the community around your product? Could you use a social network? Should you create a website or forum of your own that gets users sharing their stories?</p>
<p>Community building pays off. It&rsquo;s a long-term investment, but a powerful one if tackled at the right time. Be patient and caring and your community will flourish!</p>
<h2 id="over-to-you">Over to you</h2>
<p>Content marketing isn&rsquo;t easy, and all of the companies mentioned here are well established and have been playing the game for a long time, but the results can be astounding.</p>
<p>One of the great things about content is that it builds exponentially, and once it&rsquo;s at the peak, your content is like a glacier: big, powerful and not going anywhere.</p>
<p>How can you entertain, inform or engage your customers with content?

<html><body><p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard this before: <strong>if it&rsquo;s free, you are the product.</strong></p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google+ and every other social network are all free because they charge advertisers to reach users. It&rsquo;s a great model for them but it&rsquo;s less than ideal for the marketers doing the advertising.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>In the longterm, Facebook fans and Twitter followers could mean nothing: growing an audience on a platform you don&rsquo;t own is dangerous business and it&rsquo;s what tech writer Nicholas Carr calls <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=634" target="_blank">digital sharecropping</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2095"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the fundamental economic characteristics of Web 2.0 is the distribution of production into the hands of the many and the concentration of the economic rewards into the hands of the few. It&rsquo;s a sharecropping system, but the sharecroppers are generally happy because their interest lies in self-expression or socializing, not in making money, and, besides, the economic value of each of their individual contributions is trivial.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only by aggregating those contributions on a massive scale &ndash; on a web scale &ndash; that the business becomes lucrative. <strong>To put it a different way, the sharecroppers operate happily in an attention economy while their overseers operate happily in a cash economy.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>For marketers, it&rsquo;s difficult to avoid this issue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to &ldquo;own&rdquo; your audience, as they are already &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by someone else. Here are some common lead-generation channels whose use could be considered digital sharecropping.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Google:</strong> Visitors have always been anonymous and now they are encrypting search terms.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Pages with many fans are forced to pay to reach their own audience.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter:</strong> There is no ability to export or transfer fans into a database that can be used on other platforms.</li>
</ul><p>Do you see the issue here?</p>
<p>In each case, the platforms are propriety. These are walled-gardens, built only to serve the stakeholders that profit off them. Social networks come and go, search engines evolve. If you put all your eggs in one basket &acirc;&#128;&#148; a basket that you don&rsquo;t own &acirc;&#128;&#148; you risk losing out on years of time, energy and money spent if that platform changes its rules or shuts its doors.</p>
<h2>There is a remedy for this problem.</h2>
<p>Since the web was born <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/27/the-web-at-25-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank">25 years ago</a>, email has been the most used and most consistent online communication tool. It&rsquo;s free and nearly ubiquitous, meaning that if you can obtain an email subscriber &acirc;&#128;&#148; as opposed to a fan or follower &acirc;&#128;&#148; you can keep it forever.</p>
<p>You can take it from one email provider to the next, save it in an Excel document and even save a local copy of your database.</p>
<p>Imagine if you spent a few years and few thousand dollars building an audience of 10,000 Facebook fans. Imagine if in five years, Facebook&rsquo;s stock crashes and the company declares bankruptcy. <strong>It&rsquo;s essentially impossible to move an audience from one platform to the other.</strong> For the huge majority of those folks, it&rsquo;ll be time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Email is the best defense against digital sharecropping because it&rsquo;s 1) not going anywhere (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">the numbers prove it</a>) and 2) it&rsquo;s not owned by some corporate overload. If you aren&rsquo;t collecting email address on your site, today is the day to start.</p>
<p>This is a more pressing issue than most people realize. If we have piqued your interest, here are the answers to a few questions about email marketing and the dangers of digital sharecropping.</p>
<h2>1. Are you suggesting that I quit SEO and social media?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not. What I am suggesting, however, is that you think bigger and farther down the road.</p>
<p>Things that are popular right now &acirc;&#128;&#148; content marketing, SEO, social media, etc. &acirc;&#128;&#148; could fade (at least in their current forms) in the future. It&rsquo;s more important for businesses to think about building a database of folks who are interested in your product or service. This way, you&rsquo;ll have access to those people regardless of what happens to the Facebook&rsquo;s and Google&rsquo;s of the world.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-16/the-social-media-bubble-is-quietly-deflating" target="_blank">Bloomberg Businessweek</a> reported that venture funding was declining for social media companies. This is important because many of these companies are not profitable and will fold without investors.</p>

<p>Does this mean that social media is dying? Who knows. What we do know is that it&rsquo;s just one piece of a very large puzzle for marketers.</p>
<h2>2. What if email fades away?</h2>
<p>This is a legitimate question. People have so many ways to communicate that they might choose to use Snapchat, WhatsApp or FaceTime instead of email. Despite that, email users and email usage has shown steady growth. A report from technology research firm Radicati (<a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Email-Market-2013-2017-Executive-Summary.pdf">PDF</a>) indicates that the growth will continue for years to come.</p>

<p>Consider also that an email address is essentially our unique personal identifier online. Just about every service, including the social networks we&rsquo;ve mentioned, all require an email address to register.</p>
<h2>3. How do I start putting email to use?</h2>
<p>Start at the very beginning. You need a contact form on your site, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-guide/get-subscribers/" target="_blank">a few calls to action</a> and, assuming you plan to actually email these people, you&rsquo;ll need an <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/">email marketing provider</a>.</p>
<p>There is a ton that goes into effective email marketing. To help answer all your questions about getting started, Vero co-founder and CEO Chris Hexton created <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-guide/">The Ultimate Guide To Successful Email Marketing</a>.</p>

<html><body><p>Email marketing has been the most effective online marketing tool for the last decade.</p>
<p>When it comes to lead nurturing and customer relationship management, email marketing beats social media, SEO and content marketing hands-down. While a diverse approach to marketing is always smart, it&rsquo;s no wonder marketers want control over database of email addresses rather than lists of followers or anonymous visitors. In a world of segmentation and walled gardens, email has remained free, cross-platform and device-agnostic.</p>
<p>When you consider that 91 percent of the world&rsquo;s 2.4 billion email users check their inbox at least once each day, it&rsquo;s no wonder email remains one of the most cost-effective ways for business to discover, convert and maintain customer relationships.</p>
<p>We took a look at a number of studies, reports and surveys to help put email in perspective. The results speak for themselves. Enjoy!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zapier.com">Zapier</a> lets you <strong>connect any web app to any other web app</strong> with the click of a few buttons. With over 250 connections, a raft of great guides and a ton of useful applications, Zapier is a great weapon in any email marketers arsenal.</p>
<p>One of the greatest success stories comes from a testimonial Zapier published that outlined how KISSmetrics were able to <strong><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-increase-webinar-sign-up-rates/">increase webinar subscribe rates by 1000%</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The secret?</p>
<p>Rather than using GoToWebinar&rsquo;s rather basic landing pages and email templates, they connected their own, optimised, landing pages to their email marketing platform for huge conversions and powerful automation.</p>
<p>Without Zapier this sort of task would be a nightmare. You&rsquo;d have to code the landing page, code the API connection to your email marketing platform and setup some form of automated task to manage the email series. With Zapier this task becomes ridiculously easy.</p>
<p><strong>What you can use it for:</strong> Webinars, automated lead follow up, connecting your CRM to your email marketing software. We&rsquo;re using it right now to replicate KISSmetrics&rsquo; success with our webinar on <a href="http://pages.getvero.com/email-marketing-that-converts-webinar/">5 Game Changing Tactics To Lift Your Email Conversions</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> is a task management tool that puts the power in your hands. Rather than forcing you to use strict calendars or other opinionated rules you can setup your workflows just as you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>With awesome team management Trello lets you get more done, quickly.</p>
<p>We have used Trello at Vero over the last four months and it has contributed drastically to a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/how-the-founder-of-vero-manages-email-marketing/">450% increase in our email marketing conversions</a>.</p>
<p>Managing exactly what campaigns are going to go out each and every day and planning ahead means we&rsquo;re not scrambling to get campaigns completed and have the proper time to think about <strong>who we want to target</strong>.</p>
<p>The power of segmentation is only possible if you are have the time to strategise and plan out what you&rsquo;re going to send. Trello gives you this power.</p>
<p><strong>How you can use it:</strong> Plan out the next 2-3 weeks worth of email marketing campaigns at any one time. We recommend you setup your Trello board as below:</p>

<p>This gives you the chance to really focus on each campaign and, hopefully, get ahead so you can learn from and iterate on each and every email you send.</p>

<p>Gmail is obviously no secret.</p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;but using it to power your email marketing campaigns is something you might not have thought about.</p>
<p>One of the best sources of great email marketing ideas is inspiration from other great companies selling to your target market. Getting a feel for the sorts of campaigns that are being sent and the way customers respond is imperative if you&rsquo;re going to develop a backlog of ideas to test.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to manage your own research. Signup to a heap of sites using variations on your email address.</p>
<p>For example, rather than using <a href="mailto:chris@getvero.com">chris@getvero.com</a>, I sign up to many SaaS newsletters or services with <a href="mailto:chris+saas@getvero.com">chris+saas@getvero.com</a>. I do the same thing for online retailers with <a href="mailto:chris+ecommerce@getvero.com">chris+ecommerce@getvero.com</a> and so on.</p>
<p>The beauty of this system is that it makes it easy to setup automated filters that automatically label each of the email types.</p>
<p>When you need inspiration you can then dip into the saved campaigns: anything from SaaS email examples to webinars to eCommerce cart abandons &ndash; whatever you sign up for.</p>
<p><strong>How you can use it:</strong> Setup labels in your Gmail account like this:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="180px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png"><img data-attachment-id="1736" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/6-email-marketing-tools-increase/gmail-labels/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?fit=180%2C380&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="180,380" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gmail-labels" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?fit=142%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?fit=180%2C380&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1736" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png" alt="gmail-labels" width="180" height="380" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?w=180&amp;ssl=1 180w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?resize=142%2C300&amp;ssl=1 142w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?resize=47%2C100&amp;ssl=1 47w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?resize=24%2C50&amp;ssl=1 24w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gmail-labels.png?resize=36%2C75&amp;ssl=1 36w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></p>

<p><a href="/">Vero</a> is email marketing software with a difference. It <strong>tracks your customers actions</strong> and helps you turn these actions into targeted email campaigns that convert.</p>
<p>The focus is on trigger-based email automation and segmented newsletters.</p>
<p>By using customer behaviour as a means of segmentation you can send emails that are much more targeted. You can email customers that have used a particular feature, or purchased a certain number of times. You can test out email campaign ideas and, when they work, turn them into automated campaigns that are triggered <strong>each and every time</strong> a customer takes that same action in the future.</p>
<p>The great thing about this sort of email marketing is that it works to permanently lift conversions whilst you&rsquo;re working on other things!</p>
<p>Better yet you can A/B test and optimise your campaigns without any input from IT, which will naturally help your campaigns perform better over the long term.</p>
<p><strong>How you can use it:</strong> If you have any online business then Vero can help you turn your email marketing into a channel that matters. You can send newsletters and automated campaigns and tracking your customers is simple using Vero&rsquo;s Javascript snippet.</p>
