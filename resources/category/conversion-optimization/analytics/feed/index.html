<html><body><p>When it comes to basic data analytics, there are three key things that have changed over the last few years:</p>
<ol><li>It is easier than ever to set up a data warehouse with virtually no data limits, such as Amazon&rsquo;s AWS Redshift or Google&rsquo;s Big Query.</li>
<li>It is easier than ever to synchronize data from SaaS products into such warehouses, with tools like Stitch and Segment.</li>
<li>There are several easy-to-use, effective tools that make it trivial to query and chart the plethora of data in your warehouse in a sophisticated way, such as Mode Analytics and Looker.</li>
</ol><p>At Vero, we&rsquo;re big proponents of these advancements and how these tools work together. In most scenarios, the &ldquo;data pipeline&rdquo; outlined above is superior to tools like Mixpanel and Amplitude as it enables greater data accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&rsquo;m going to introduce you to storing and analyzing data directly in Amazon&rsquo;s Redshift using <a href="https://www.getdbt.com">DBT</a> and Mode Analytics. We&rsquo;re going to chart some the basic SaaS metrics of MRR upgrades, downgrades, new and churned MRR to get started.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve included the actual SQL we use at Vero, and I&rsquo;ve broken down how it works so you can use it, get inspired by it or build upon it.</p>
<p>The full repository of SQL can be found <a href="https://github.com/getvero/dbt-saas">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can apply the same approach I use here to chart virtually <em>anything</em> with this setup, it&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<h2>Charting upgrades, downgrades, new revenue and churn</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the chart we&rsquo;ll be building (note that &ldquo;news&rdquo; means new MRR in this chart):</p>
<figure class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/dha4w82d62smt.cloudfront.net/items/2C3x2J321G3B1X2M3H33/charting-mrr-movements-sql-dbt-redshift.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><h2>What you&rsquo;ll need for graphing net churn</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the setup you&rsquo;ll need to get accurate and complete data and to chart it beautifully:</p>
<ul><li>An AWS Redshift database to store all of your data.</li>
<li>StitchData to synchronise data from Stripe (or your invoicing platform) to Redshift.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com">DBT</a> to turn the unorganised, raw data that is synchronised from Stripe into Redshift into clean database &ldquo;views&rdquo; you can query to create pretty charts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sinterdata.com">Sinter</a> to run <code>DBT</code> queries daily (or more often) so that your charts are up to date.</li>
<li>Mode Analytics to query the clean database views generated by DBT and Sinter to create beautiful charts.</li>
</ul><p>All up, these components cost around $480 USD per month. They&rsquo;re all scalable to virtually any limit, so you can rest assured they&rsquo;ll scale with you as you grow.</p>
<h2>Synchronising your data to Redshift</h2>
<h2>The SQL</h2>
<p>To help you, we&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/getvero/dbt-saas">pulled together a Github repository</a> with all of the SQL needed to create these charts. As you become more familiar with DBT, you&rsquo;ll observe that this repository is structured in line with DBT&rsquo;s best practices and is a module that you should be able to import into another DBT project.</p>
<p>The SQL here ultimately outputs a table called <code>revenue_movements</code>. This table contains one row for each month and one column each of the metrics <code>new_revenue</code>, <code>churned_revenue</code>, <code>upgrade_revenue</code> and <code>downgrade_revenue</code>.</p>
<p>The resulting table can easily be queried using a tool like Mode.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I recommend you download the <a href="getvero.com">full SQL</a> and follow along in a text editor like Sublime.</p>
<p>Below I&rsquo;ll step through each of the SQL queries used to build up the <code>revenue_movements</code> view.</p>
<h3>Getting a nice clean list of all invoices</h3>
<p>All of the SQL we&rsquo;ll be writing here is formatted in line with the structure outlined by DBT. Every SQL query is a <code>SELECT</code> and results in a table or view. This table or view can then be used by other DBT queries. This &ldquo;stacking&rdquo; helps create clean and reusable SQL. You can read more about <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint">DBT&rsquo;s viewpoint / manifest here</a>.</p>
<p>Onto the SQL! The first step in the process of creating our chart is to generate a view called <code>stripe_invoices</code> that has a row for every single customer invoice.</p>
<p>When using <code>DBT</code>, I like to follow a standard structure for my SQL code inside the <code>models</code> folder:</p>
<ul><li>I have a folder named after the source of the data, e.g. <code>stripe</code>.</li>
<li>Within that folder I always have a <code>base</code> folder. The SQL files inside the <code>base</code> folder are responsible for querying the underlying raw dataset and returning <strong>only</strong> the columns needed by our queries later on.
<ul><li>I will also do exclusions in these SQL files if I have any. </li>
<li>Files in this folder are always named using the format <code>PROVIDER_MODEL.sql</code>, for example <code>stripe_invoices.sql</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I also have a <code>transform</code> folder. The SQL in this folder is responsible for taking the <code>base</code> output, e.g. <code>stripe_invoices</code>, and converting values into a more usable format, where useful.
<ul><li>These files are always named with the <code>_xf</code> suffix, as in <code>stripe_invoices_xf.sql</code>.</li>
<li>Critically, the base SQL should never be queried other than by it&rsquo;s corresponding transform query. The point is that <strong>all queries</strong> from here on use the <strong>transformed</strong> models, and never directly call the base models. This gives everything a reliable structure with a <strong>lot</strong> of flexibility. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Here&rsquo;s the SQL from the <code>stripe_invoices</code> base table:</p>
<pre><code>select
  id                      as id,
  amount_due              as amount_due,
  customer                as customer,
  date                    as date,
  period_end              as period_end,
  forgiven                as forgiven,
  paid                    as paid,
  subscription            as subscription,
  total                   as total,
  starting_balance        as starting_balance
from
  {{ var('invoices_table') }}
where
  -- Remove customer IDs of users who will mess up MRR and other figures (e.g test accounts)
  customer not in ('cus_3Ma5IxIINayMgK')
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s pretty basic. The next step is to add in a few transformations. </p>
<p>In this particular example, I want to include customers&rsquo; <code>email</code> addresses, but this data is not available in the raw Stripe invoices table, so I need to join another table to get it. Similarly, I want to include an index of the invoice number for each customer (i.e. first invoice, last invoice, etc.) so I&rsquo;ll add a query for this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the transform SQL:</p>
<pre><code>with 

stripe_invoices_with_line_items as (
  select 
    * 
  from 
    {{ ref('stripe_invoices_with_line_items_xf_aggregated') }}
), 

usage_based_recipients as (
  select
    *
  from
    {{ ref('usage_based_recipients') }}
)

select 
  stripe_invoices.id                              as id,
  stripe_invoices.customer                        as customer,
  stripe_customers_xf.email                       as customer_email,
  stripe_invoices.date                            as date,
  stripe_invoices.period_end                      as period_end,
  stripe_invoices.forgiven                        as forgiven,
  stripe_invoices.subscription                    as subscription,
  stripe_invoices.paid                            as paid,
  stripe_invoices_with_line_items.total           as total,
  row_number() over(
    partition by stripe_invoices.customer 
    order by stripe_invoices.date desc
  )                                               as last_payment,
  row_number() over(
    partition by stripe_invoices.customer 
    order by stripe_invoices.date asc
  )                                               as first_payment
from 
  {{ ref('stripe_invoices') }} stripe_invoices
left outer join
  stripe_invoices_with_line_items
on
  stripe_invoices.id = stripe_invoices_with_line_items.id
left outer join
  {{ ref('stripe_customers_xf') }} as stripe_customers_xf
on
  stripe_customers_xf.id = stripe_invoices.customer
</code></pre>
<p>As you an see, I&rsquo;m leveraging another transformed dataset, the <code>customers_xf</code> table. The <code>invoices_xf</code> resulting from the above query has all of the data I might want later.</p>
<h3>Querying for new revenue per month</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve done to the hard work of creating a clean table of all of our customer invoices, it is relatively easy to query for revenue movements.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with &ldquo;new revenue per month&rdquo;, as per the file <code>mrr_new.sql</code>:</p>
<pre><code>select
  date_trunc('month', date) as month,
  sum(total)
from
  {{ref('invoices_by_customer')}}
where
  -- Find customers who had their first invoice this month
  asc_row = 1 
group by
  date_trunc('month', date)
</code></pre>
<p>This SQL finds all of the initial invoices for each customer and groups and sums them by month (e.g. January, February, etc.). You&rsquo;ll note that the SQL leverages a table called <code>invoices_by_customer.sql</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with 

invoices_by_customer as (
  select
    customer_id,
    date_trunc('month',date) as month,
    sum(total) as total
  from
    {{ ref('invoices') }}
  group by
    customer_id,
    date_trunc('month',date)
)

select 
  *,
  row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by month asc)   as asc_row 
  row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by month desc)  as desc_row 
from 
  invoices_by_customer
</code></pre>
<p>This SQL groups the invoices by customer and month. This interim step is key as it is possible in Stripe that customers have two invoices in a single month. This aggregation ensures that for each month there is just one total &ldquo;invoiced&rdquo; count per customer. The <code>asc_row</code> thus accurately represents an index for each customer&rsquo;s invoices starting in the first month they paid and counting upwards. </p>
<h3>Querying for upgrades per month</h3>
<p>Querying for upgrades requires comparing two months and determining the difference between those two months. The SQL is located in <code>mrr_upgrades.sql</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with

find_upgrades as (
  select 
    invoices.month                                                as month,
    invoices.asc_row                                              as asc_row,
    invoices.total                                                as current_month_total,
    coalesce(invoices_offset_one_month.total,0)                   as last_month_total,
    invoices.total - coalesce(invoices_offset_one_month.total,0)  as change
  from 
    {{ref('invoices_by_customer')}} invoices
  left outer join 
    {{ref('invoices_by_customer')}} invoices_offset_one_month
  on 
    add_months(invoices.month, -1) = invoices_offset_one_month.month
  and 
    invoices.customer_id = invoices_offset_one_month.customer_id
)

select
  month         as month,
  sum(change)   as revenue
from
  upgrades
where
  -- Only include customers whose current month total is more than last month (upgrades!)
  abs(upgrades.current_month_total) &gt; 
  upgrades.last_month_total
and 
  -- Exclude customers who didn't move plans this month
  upgrades.change &lt;&gt; 0 and upgrades.change is not null
and
  -- Exclude customer's first invoices, as these are actually "new" customers, not upgrades
  upgrades.asc_row &lt;&gt; 1
group by
  upgrades.month
</code></pre>
<p>This query leverages the same <code>invoices_by_customer</code> table twice &ndash; once to query the total for &ldquo;this month&rdquo; and once to query the total for &ldquo;last month&rdquo;. It then displays the <strong>difference</strong> each of these totals.</p>
<p>We also need to ensure we exclude:</p>
<ul><li>Customers that have their <em>first invoice</em> <strong>this</strong> month, as those are already counted in the earlier <code>mrr_new</code> query. They represent customers who are new and, as they didn&rsquo;t have an invoice prior to their starting, there will always be a change recorded in their first month.</li>
<li>Customers who have invoices with a total of <code>0</code> <em>this</em> month, as these are customers who have churned &ndash; we&rsquo;ll query them separately.</li>
<li>Customers who have a <em>negative</em> change, as these are customers who have downgraded since last month.</li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;re left with a clean table containing the upgrades per month across our invoice history.</p>
<h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>The files <code>mrr_churns</code> and <code>mrr_downgrades</code> provide the SQL to chart these numbers. They are similar to the queries above.</p>
<p>With the key metrics of new revenue, churned revenue, upgrades and downgrades accounted for, we can now bring these figures together. DBT separates <code>models</code> (like those above) and <code>analysis</code> SQL files into two. I always put the final SQL that I will copy and paste into Mode into the <code>analysis</code> folder. The SQL within that folder represents each SQL query used to build our dashboards.</p>
<p>The file <code>revenue/mrr_movements.sql</code> joins the <code>mrr_new</code>, <code>mrr_upgrades</code>, <code>mrr_downgrades</code> and <code>mrr_churns</code> tables discussed above:</p>
<pre><code>select
  new_revenue.month,
  new_revenue.revenue         as new_revenue,
  churned_revenue.revenue     as churned_revenue,
  upgrade_revenue.revenue     as upgrade_revenue,
  downgrade_revenue.revenue   as downgrade_revenue
from
  {{ref('mrr_new')}} new_revenue
left outer join
  {{ref('mrr_churned')}} churned_revenue
on
  new_revenue.month = churned_revenue.month
left outer join
  {{ref('mrr_upgrades')}} upgrade_revenue
on
  new_revenue.month = upgrade_revenue.month
left outer join
  {{ref('mrr_downgrades')}} downgrade_revenue
on
  new_revenue.month = downgrade_revenue.month
where
  -- This works in Redshift, not in Postgres
  new_revenue.month &lt; date_trunc('month',dateadd(months,-1,current_date))
order by
  new_revenue.month desc
</code></pre>
<p>There are two important things about this query:</p>
<ul><li>Using <code>left outer join</code> ensures that if any of the joined tables are missing a value for a certain month, those months are included but with a <code>null</code> value.</li>
<li>We exclude the current month as always renders incomplete and shows generally alarming figures until the month ends.</li>
</ul><h2>Why use SQL at all?</h2>
<p>The thing I find most powerful about charting in this way is that the result is <code>idempotent</code>. This is a fancy engineering word that means &ldquo;you can run it hundreds of times and get the same output&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks to Stitch, Redshift, and DBT you can reload the raw data and re-run the queries and get the exact output every time. One of the challenges I&rsquo;ve always found with Amplitude, Mixpanel, and others is that sending data via API makes it easy to load raw data twice or to have poor visibility on <strong>which</strong> data <strong>is</strong> present. I feel this approach solves that.</p>
<p>On top of that, the beauty of using SQL for this sort of charting is that you can:</p>
<ul><li>Fully customise your charts.</li>
<li>Query across datasets and event databases, allowing you to do really sophisticated analyses. </li>
<li>Check your SQL code into GitHub or similar so you have a versioned history of every query and dashboard.</li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;ve found running SQL queries allows us to produce consolidated reports which actually get looked at and actioned. It&rsquo;s forced us to be selective about what we query and this may be one of the most valuable aspects of the whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;this script is slightly different from the one we use in production and has been pared down for this article, so if you see improvements or breaking code (though, it has been tested with our setup), please let me know and we&rsquo;ll update it.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>An introduction to analyzing your <em>email</em> data using SQL and a Redshift datastore.</p>
<p>Using data sent to a Redshift database from <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Vero</a>, we&rsquo;ll put together a chart that will help you start to conceptualize how you could build out a detailed and accurate <em>Email Dashboard</em> for your organization.</p>
<p>This will also further the skills you need to analyze your email marketing data when joining it up with the rest of your customer data, using your own data warehouse and SQL charting tools.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we talked about how you could <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/graphing-net-churn-using-redshift-sql/">graph your Net Churn</a> using SQL. This was to introduce you to the world of data warehousing and detailed analysis using your own data.</p>
<p>The post generated <strong>huge interest </strong>so this week we&rsquo;re focusing on email, an area in which we aim to set the benchmark for what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<h2 class="mti_font_element">Charting open rates for your latest newsletter campaigns</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the chart we&rsquo;ll be building.</p>

<li class="mti_font_element">We also use our own database with data about our users (in this case, we won&rsquo;t be using this data, but we will in the future). Our application uses a mixture of datastores, but a PostgreSQL database contains the most relevant data.</li>
</ul><p>This might sound complex, but all of these steps are a one to five-click process to get running. Once running, you have a really robust pipeline of user interaction data that you can use to build out sophisticated analyses any time you want.</p>
<h2>Building your &lsquo;deliveries&rsquo; and &lsquo;opens&rsquo; data models</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re getting started with your SQL email analysis, the hardest part is getting your data in order.</p>
<p>The first step to creating the chart above is to create two <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_view.asp" target="_blank">SQL Views</a>, one for your deliveries, and one for your opens. These views will represent a nice, clean view of all opens and all deliveries in your datastore, transformed and filtered to remove any junk. We&rsquo;ll then use these tables to build out our charts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into <strong>deliveries</strong> first.</p>
<p>Using the setup described above, your email data sends up in a Redshift database table via Segment. This is part of a large table called <code>track</code>, representing every user action that you have tracked via Segment (note: this includes any on-site activity, not just email deliveries).</p>
<p>For this analysis, create an SQL view called <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_base</code>. As you can see, this will view returning all of the raw fields you need for your analysis.</p>
<pre><code>create or replace view vero_analysis_deliveries_base as (

  select 
    veroproduction.track.event                        as event,
    veroproduction.track.user_id                      as user_id,
    veroproduction.track.context__traits__email       as context__traits_email,
    veroproduction.track.properties__campaign_name    as properties__campaign_name,
    veroproduction.track.properties__email_subject    as properties__email_subject,
    veroproduction.track.properties__email_type       as properties__email_type,
    veroproduction.track.timestamp                    as timestamp
  from 
    veroproduction.track
    
);</code></pre>
<p>This view can now be queried anytime and has <strong>only</strong> the data you need to create your email analysis charts.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an SQL view called <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered</code>. In this view, select everything from the previous view, and filter out anything you don&rsquo;t need. In this case we don&rsquo;t want to filter anything, but it&rsquo;s worth highlighting this step to help you learn to structure your data better.</p>
<pre><code>create or replace view vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered as (

  select 
    *
  from 
    vero_analysis_deliveries_base
  where
    vero_analysis_sent_base.event = 'Email Delivered'
  and
    vero_analysis_deliveries_base.timestamp is not null

);</code></pre>
<p>At this point, these views include all the data we need to create our tables, so it&rsquo;s time to transform and normalize the formats for various columns (such as date columsn).</p>
<p>In this case we only want to see <code>Email Delivered</code> events (not the other Segment events) so you&rsquo;ll want to filter out any other data in the <code>track</code> table.</p>
<p>To do this, create a view called <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed</code>. This table will select everything from the <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered</code> table and transform various columns, like the <code>received_at</code> column, into a consistent format.</p>
<pre><code>create or replace view vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed as (

  select 
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.user_id                      as user_id,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.context__traits_email        as user_email,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.properties__campaign_name    as campaign_name,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.properties__email_subject    as campaign_subject,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.properties__email_type       as campaign_type,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.timestamp::timestamp         as date
  from 
    [vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered]
  order by 
    date desc
    
);</code></pre>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! This is the final view you need to do the analysis. At this point the data is accurate, clean and it has it&rsquo;s columns formatted in a way that makes it easy to query any time.</p>
<p>Full credit to the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/jthandy">Tristan Handy</a> at <a href="https://rjmetrics.com/products/pipeline">RJMetrics</a> for this approach.</p>
<h2>Creating your chart</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got everything you need, you can begin charting.</p>
<p>To create the chart mentioned in this post you need to query a table that has three columns: <code>campaign_name</code>, <code>deliveries</code> (the number of emails that were delivered), <code>opens</code> (the number of emails that were opened) and <code>open_rate</code> (the percentage open rate).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the SQL to do this.</p>
<pre><code>with latest_newsletters as (
  select 
    campaign_name,
    max(date) as date
  from  
    [vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed]
  where
    campaign_type = 'newsletter'
  and
    campaign_name not like '%CLONE%'
  group by
    campaign_name
  order by
    max(date) desc
  limit 10
),

opens as (
  select 
    campaign_name,
    count(user_email) as opens
  from
    [vero_analysis_opens_transformed]
  group by
     campaign_name
),

deliveries as (
  select 
    campaign_name,
    count(user_email) as deliveries
  from
    [vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed]
  group by
     campaign_name
)
  
select 
  opens.campaign_name,
  deliveries.deliveries,
  opens.opens,
  (opens.opens::decimal  / deliveries.deliveries::decimal) as open_rate
from
  opens
join
  deliveries
on
  opens.campaign_name = deliveries.campaign_name
where
  opens.campaign_name in (
    select 
      campaign_name
    from
      latest_newsletters
  )</code></pre>
<p>What is presented here comprises of three key steps.</p>
<p>Firstly, this SQL creates a temporary table that returns only the top ten most recent <strong>newsletters</strong> that you&rsquo;ve sent. It does this by looking at the deliveries table and, for each campaign (grouped by the campaign name), returns the time of the last (<code>max</code>) email that was delivered.</p>
<p>You can then order by this field and return just ten campaigns. It&rsquo;s also important, for this example, to filter down just the newsletters and not other automated campaigns (since you&rsquo;ll have data on all of your emails from Vero).</p>
<p>Secondly, this SQL creates temporary tables that count how many deliveries and opens there were per <code>campaign_name</code>. Each of these temporary tables is separate. They return just the <code>campaign_name</code> and the count for the type of interaction we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Finally, we combine the campaign_name and opens temporary tables to return the <code>campaign_name</code>, the count of emails delivered and the count of emails opened. As part of this step we can do some maths to return a decimal number representing the percentage of emails that were opened.</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s it!</strong> The final output is a table that you can use to create the graph above.</p>
<p>I charted my example using a bar chart to help compare absolute opens with absolute deliveries. I then used a line chart to highlight large peaks in open rate on a second Y axis. This gives a clearer perspective of each metric.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This post was just an appetizer. This is a very basic analysis of your email data and forms the basis for much more complex, useful and interesting analysis.</p>

<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s hard to measure the success of an email campaign, so we&rsquo;re coming up with a better way. This post is an overview of the process we&rsquo;re using as we measure and update our own campaigns. Some of the results are great and some aren&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ve chosen one with mixed results to share here since there are more takeaways.</p>
<p><em>Would you like to see a reporting tool like this in Vero? Drop a note in the comments.</em></p>
<h2>A Better Way to Visualize Email Data</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to measure the success or failure of a single email, but what about an entire campaign? The table below is similar to what most email marketers see when they check their analytics. It&rsquo;s useful but it&rsquo;s essentially raw data. We&rsquo;ve found a better way to visualize this data and we&rsquo;re going to show you how to do it using our own blog welcome campaign (new blog subscribers receive this as an intro the blog and our service). Here&rsquo;s a look at the campaign. Click the link on the right to see the actual email.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Not all of the emails in this campaign contain full articles so there is no incentive for the recipient to click. Also, you&rsquo;ll notice a mix of HTML, plain text, long form and short form. The goal is to collect data on different formats.</em></p>

<p>The first thing we did was separate the open rate and click rate so we could chart each individually.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="217px"><img data-attachment-id="4832" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/measure-email-marketing-campaigns/vero-click-rate/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?fit=217%2C309&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="217,309" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero click rate" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?fit=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?fit=217%2C309&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4832" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png" alt="vero click rate" width="217" height="309" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?w=217&amp;ssl=1 217w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?resize=70%2C100&amp;ssl=1 70w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?resize=35%2C50&amp;ssl=1 35w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vero-click-rate1.png?resize=53%2C75&amp;ssl=1 53w" sizes="(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px"></p>
<p>Next, we highlighted the data and clicked the &ldquo;Chart&rdquo; button. We wanted to use a trend line in our chart, so we selected a scatter chart.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnaIcFqem7KDieh-2f0QjZvmU75CtglN5eZvOtAmtyA/pubchart?oid=302217027&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>We did the same thing for open and click rates.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnaIcFqem7KDieh-2f0QjZvmU75CtglN5eZvOtAmtyA/pubchart?oid=1162935402&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>This is a cool way to view the data because it&rsquo;s very easy to see which emails are killing it and which need to be cut (or seriously edited). The next step was combining the data into one chart.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnaIcFqem7KDieh-2f0QjZvmU75CtglN5eZvOtAmtyA/pubchart?oid=662452951&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>Looks awesome, right? Now, let&rsquo;s see what it tells us.</p>
<h2>How to Read This Data</h2>
<p>Engagement is highest through the first four emails, meaning that is when we should be using strong calls to action and maybe even offering extended free trials or deals on the service. Here are a few other takeaways:</p>
<ul><li>Open rates decline throughout the campaign but click rates stay relatively even. The group clicking through in the latter stages of the campaign that haven&rsquo;t already started a free trial should be sent a special offer.</li>
<li>The email with the highest click rate &ndash; a whopping 19.10% &ndash; is simply a link to our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-guide/">Ultimate Guide to Successful Email Marketing</a>. These people want content and we need to do a better job providing <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-resources/">&ldquo;epic&rdquo; resources</a> like this one.</li>
<li>The email with the lowest open rate is also content (link) but it&rsquo;s not focused directly on email. People signed up for email resources and the data is proving that&rsquo;s what they want.</li>
<li>There are a few significant drops from one email to the next. Between emails #4 and #5, the click rate drops from 19.1% to 8.76%. We earned trust and threw it away in the next email. Emails that build trust are the perfect runway for a strong call to action. In this case, both emails offer great content but #5 simply isn&rsquo;t good enough.</li>
</ul><p>Anything else you would take away from this data? Give it a try on your own campaigns and let us know the results.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>

<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>

<p><strong>6. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>

Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since we rolled out the new system on February 19, our daily subscriber rate has doubled, even on weekends when activity dips considerably.

<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances.

<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed. It&rsquo;s bad news for poorly run companies, as consumers are about twice as likely to share bad customer experiences.</p></blockquote>

<p>Taking a look at its competitors, the authors note that it&rsquo;s this focus on &ldquo;the dry stuff &ndash; tools, workflow and process&rdquo; that has resulted in BuzzFeed&rsquo;s explosive growth. Rather than relying on quality journalism to market itself, getting content to lots of people requires baking business interests into the product from the get-go.</p></blockquote>

<p>This post <em>actually</em> lives up to the billing. Take the table of content as an accurate prelude to what you&rsquo;ll get in this massive post from Oli Gardner (Unbounce co-founder) on the Moz blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>First I&rsquo;ll give you the only rationale you&rsquo;ll ever need to explain why landing pages are to marketers, what Immodium is to an astronaut with diarrhea. Essential.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll prove why context &ndash; not content &ndash; is king when it comes to conversion.</li>
<li>Following that, I will make you fall in love with forms. FYI, it&rsquo;s really, really hard to make form love a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Mid way through we&rsquo;ll sip some Canadian Club, get our Don Draper on, and learn how to write copy like the Mad Men (and Women).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Paint me a pretty picture Johnny!&rdquo; &ldquo;Screw you mommy. Design is not just rainbows and unicorns!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Is it greedy to want a second helping when you&rsquo;re an orphan? Not if you have my name. (It&rsquo;s Oliver in case you&rsquo;re confused).</li>
<li>Always ask for more when it comes to conversion .And finally, I&rsquo;ll put my art critic hat on and rip into some landing page examples, both good and bad.</li>

<p>This post is a beast at 2,300 words but it&rsquo;s loaded with ideas to make your emails smarter and more effective. Have you ever, for example, who your email is <em>really</em> from?</p>
<blockquote><p>Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email really from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized.</p></blockquote>

<p>Longform content has to be really, really good in order to keep our attention, and The Daily Egg does it right. This 1,500-word post, which is the fifth in a five part series, covers testing landing pages from top to bottom.</p>
<blockquote><p>To optimize anything, you need to conduct a scientific experiment, carefully analyze the results, select the optimal result, and repeat. If everything is done correctly, the results get better and better over time.</p>
<p>This concept applies very nicely to website design.</p>
<p>A good website design is one that delivers consistently high conversion rates. But even the best websites can increase conversions. You simply need to know how.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends. In addition to social media, email is one of the main reasons that home pages receive less traffic than ever. Rather than going looking for news and content, people get it delivered to them. Just one more reason to spend extra time developing <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-increase-revenue-34-percent/" target="_blank">strategic email newsletters</a>.</p>

<p>This post is more than a year old but after hearing Joanna speak at the Authority conference, I felt it was important to share. She breaks down which words are great for conversion and which words should be avoided at all costs. It&rsquo;s a great read.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friction words are words that describe things people <em>have</em> to do &ndash; not things people <em>want</em> to do. They cause cognitive friction. Web copy that converts is focused on what people <em>want</em> to do.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>32. <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64822-can-win-back-email-campaigns-help-reactivate-lapsed-customers">Can win-back email campaigns help reactivate lapsed customers?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tommy Walker from ConversionXL has a way of articulating complex growth strategies in a way that anyone can understand. He dug through a number of reports and studies to explain exactly how and why businesses should be paying close attention to their onboarding process. There are plenty of examples and action items &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; don&rsquo;t miss this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just so I&rsquo;m clear, when I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Email Onboarding&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not talking about newsletters or batch &amp; blast messaging that asks me to read your latest blog post.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is creating a narrative in the inbox that &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; seamlessly transitions me from &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; by acknowledging how I interact with the stuff you send me and adjusting itself accordingly, made possible by trigger &amp; behavioral based email rules.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>36. <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/your-next-email-subject-line/" target="_blank">4 Hacks You Should Know Before You Craft Your Next Email Subject Line</a></strong></p>
<p>We love hacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that we really liked Zach Bulygo&rsquo;s post on subject line hacks on the KISSmetrics blog. These tips are straightforward, simple and potentially very powerful. Keep this bookmarked for the next time you are struggling with a subject line.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no such thing as the perfect subject line. As a marketer, you need to test your subject lines and see which ones get the most opens. (Now, clearly, getting people to open your email is only one part. After that you need to get them to click or tap on something in the email.) But you&rsquo;ve won half the battle if you can get them to open the email.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>37. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html" target="_blank">What is spam?</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Godin, the father of permission marketing, offers a philosophical explanation of spam. In short, spam destroys trust. Read on to see how to earn trust and keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had never heard of the Weigel distribution but it&rsquo;s application to content marketing is spot on. Basically, the longer a visitor stays on your site, the less likely they are to leave. The principle is simple but getting those visitors interested in the first place isn&rsquo;t easy. Nate Munger breaks it down with plenty of examples and tips.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/how-long-stay.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>
<p>If you can keep them for 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re almost as likely to keep them for 2 minutes or more.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emirates kicks off the list with this email, sent a few weeks before an international departure. By using their data they have singled out customers that are a) traveling a long distance, b) traveling economy, c) traveling soon and d) on an aircraft with and upgrade available. The copy to &lsquo;make us an offer&rsquo; likely gets a lot of click-throughs: it&rsquo;s different from the usual &lsquo;Pay $X to upgrade now&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t forget that using a future activity as the trigger point for an email is a great opportunity to upsell or re-engage customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a> send out this awesome email when you create your fifth &lsquo;pad&rsquo;. In the Hackpad world this is a sign of activation: it&rsquo;s a sign you&rsquo;re fully engaged with the product.</p>
<p>Every SaaS company should be sending something like this. Not only does it congratulate the recipient but it encourages them to check out another popular feature. This not only gets them back to Hackpad&rsquo;s site but is genuinely helpful and encourages the customer to try something they may not have used yet. If they like it, there&rsquo;s every chance they&rsquo;ll be a customer sooner and for longer.</p>

<p>If you take a call on <a href="http://clarity.fm">Clarity.fm</a>, the savvy marketers there will be sure to follow up with this email campaign. When developing your lifecycle emails it&rsquo;s important to reflect on Dave McClure&rsquo;s infamous <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/06/internet-market.html">AARRR</a> metrics.</p>
<p>Clarity nails the <em>retention</em> &lsquo;R&rsquo; with this email. For anyone that has had a call via Clarity, you&rsquo;ll know that there is often a ton of follow-up questions and &lsquo;homework&rsquo; coming out of your calls. This email takes advantage of that fact and is a genuinely useful reminder to touch base with the mentors you&rsquo;ve spoken to.</p>

<p>A great data-driven email, YouTube used this email to target customers that had watched any of 2013&rsquo;s trending videos. The goal here is to get viewers that would be considered &lsquo;tastemakers&rsquo; or &lsquo;influencers&rsquo; to re-watch something they may have enjoyed early in the year and get them to share it again, perhaps even to &lsquo;brag&rsquo; that they&rsquo;d seen it first.</p>

<p>This is a simple email. It&rsquo;s not sexy, it doesn&rsquo;t even have a digital call to action&hellip;but there is something magical about the way the physical device on my wrist virtually sends me a reminder when it&rsquo;s battery is low.</p>
<p>This campaign is an example of <strong>surprise</strong>. How can you surprise and delight your customers with something as helpful as this email from FitBit?</p>

<p>Mouseflow helps you track your customers&rsquo; on-site mouse movements. They have to ensure their customers install Javascript on their website and they use this campaign to help get them over the line. This is more unique than other activation emails we&rsquo;ve seen recently as the call to action asks customers to &lsquo;claim their bonus&rsquo;. In a way, the bonus is artificial. It&rsquo;s designed to get customers installed faster and it&rsquo;s worth it to Mouseflow to reward the users that do install the Javascript with a little extra as, ultimately, there&rsquo;s a much higher chance they&rsquo;ll activate than if they don&rsquo;t get the Javascript installed at all.</p>

<p>If, at any point, you use LinkedIn&rsquo;s Address Book import feature then you&rsquo;ll notice a list of LinkedIn contacts that &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t yet on LinkedIn&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If any of these contacts every join, you&rsquo;ll get an email like the one above. The idea is to help seed the new user&rsquo;s profile with a flurry of new contacts straight away, as well to increase your own network. A win-win for you, the new use and LinkedIn, this is a quality campaign.</p>

<p>At Vero, we use Facebook&rsquo;s retargeting and ad features, though sparingly. This campaign from Facebook appears to have been targeted after I had not logged into our Facebook business account for a period.</p>
<p>All three calls to action lead to the exact same page: a guide for getting started with Facebook&rsquo;s ad targeting tools. The focus and aim of this campaign are perfect for B2B lifecycle email. Targeting customers that are active users but may have gone a little quiet or <strong>have not</strong> used a particular feature is the perfect way to build up engagement or make more money.</p>

<p>We all know that Amazon <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/6-lessons-you-can-learn-from-amazons-killer-email-marketing/">sends some of the best email marketing around</a> and this campaign is no exception.</p>
<p>A little different to some that I&rsquo;ve seen before, this campaign is sent when you browse or buy in a particular category and the recommendations are very accurate.</p>

<p>The following email from BigCommerce was sent just before Christmas. We&rsquo;ve got a few demo accounts for BigCommerce for testing. This campaign gets a mention, not because it&rsquo;s particularly data-driven in it&rsquo;s copy, but because of BigCommerce&rsquo;s approach to it&rsquo;s delivery.</p>
<p>Check out these from addresses:</p>

<p>It looks like BigCommerce assigns individual customer service representatives to each account. This is a great way to spread the load and create a truly personal experience. What a fantastic example.</p>

<p>CodeClimate is a very useful application for a company built on technology. Their notification emails are great for two reasons: 1. they&rsquo;re clear and direct, and 2. they don&rsquo;t make you go back to the website to get value from them. This particular example is twice as good, as the team at CodeClimate have dynamically inserted a notification that your trial is about to expire. This is how you should be doing trigger-based, transactional email.</p>

<p>Pocket&rsquo;s year-end email is reminiscent of LinkedIn&rsquo;s <a>top 5% of user&rsquo;s campaign</a> last year. The copy of the email gives it a personal touch despite the fact that Pocket has over 7.5 million users, making the top 1% a rather large 74,000. Using data to create a personal message is powerful and there is no doubt you could use your own data to create an email just like this.</p>

<p>Another example from Fitbit (crushing it here) is this 2013 summary email. Pulling data for each and every customer and combining it with some cheeky copy gives this campaign a unique feel. &ldquo;A turtle would take <em>364</em> days to skateboard that fast&rdquo; is a fantastic way to present data and a great example of fun copy.</p>
<p>How can you combine a positive, fun tone with customer data to create something different?</p>

<p>Paypal have been working extremely hard over the last year to improve their branding and online toolset. This email is an interesting one. It was triggered when the account had a positive balance that had not been touched for a while. The call to action is a little vague but this is an effective email to remind inactive customers that <strong>do</strong> have the ability to make purchases or send money that they shouldn&rsquo;t forget about their Paypal balance.</p>
<p>How can you target inactivity and segment out users that can take positive action <strong>immediately</strong>?</p>

<html><body><ul><li>Google have now started caching images for all emails opened via Gmail.</li>
<li>This means images are displayed by default, <strong>generally a good thing for email marketers</strong>.</li>
<li>This will have an impact on how <strong>opens</strong> are tracked and it&rsquo;s interesting and important to understand why.</li>
</ul><p>Throughout 2013 Google made a number of changes to Gmail, in particular their &acirc;&#128;&#152;tabbed inbox&rsquo; feature.</p>
<p>In early December last year, Google announced a new change to the way <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/images-now-showing.html">images are being handled by the Gmail client</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1374"></span></p>
<p>Images will now be displayed <strong>by default</strong> rather than asking recipients on a one-to-one basis whether they&rsquo;d like to load images.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Gmail put it themselves:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="500px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Images.gif"><img alt="Images" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Images.gif" width="500" height="430"></a></p>
<p>Rather than seeing &acirc;&#128;&#152;Display images&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll just get the images:</p>
<h2 id="how-this-impacts-you">How this impacts you</h2>
<p>Firstly, it&rsquo;s a positive change!</p>
<p>Email marketing software tracks opens using a small image (1px by 1px side) at the end of an email. The image is unique for every email sent.</p>
<p>When a customer opens your email this image is loaded which requires a call to a server. Using the unique &acirc;&#128;&#152;name&rsquo; of the image, the server knows who loaded the image, where they were and the time it occurred. In many other cases you can also glean useful meta-data such as the browser and email client the recipient is using.</p>
<p>Many email clients do load images by default but, for a long time, Gmail has had images <strong>disabled by default</strong>.</p>
<p>This has meant that open figures for recipients using Gmail have been underreported by email marketing tools, simply because there has been no reliable technical way to ensure recipients enabled their images.</p>
<p>As Gmail has announced they&rsquo;ll be displaying images <strong>by default</strong>. This means that open rates will, in fact, be <strong>more accurately reported</strong> for recipients using Gmail as Google will <strong>definitely</strong> load the tracking pixel at least once, rather than leaving the decision to the recipient.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-impacts-marketers-negatively">How this impacts marketers negatively</h2>
<p>The caveat to the above is that Google will be <strong>caching</strong> the image that is loaded.</p>
<p>What this means it that the image will be loaded via Google&rsquo;s web servers and a copy will be saved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the process looks as a diagram:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/caching.png"><img alt="caching" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/caching.png" width="640" height="450"></a></p>
<p>Due to Google&rsquo;s caching the image will only ever be loaded from <strong>their servers</strong>. This potentially limits the meta-data that can be taken from the image request: the recipient&rsquo;s computer will appear as one of Google&rsquo;s servers. Rather than saying the email was opened in Dubrovnik, Croatia, it&rsquo;ll say it was opened in Mountain View, California (or some other Google data center).</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>
<p>There is nothing specific you need to do other than be aware of these changes and how it impacts the way you interpret your data!</p>
<p>The change is already live for most Gmail customers. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this change appears to affect all Gmail clients, <em>including</em> the iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that customers using <em>other</em> email clients are <strong>completely unaffected</strong>.</p>
<p>The changes are, on the whole, a step in a good direction. There are a number of reasons Google is likely to have implemented these changes but they quote security as number one and this seems likely. Ensuring that emails to do not contain malware is an excellent outcome of the changes. Speed is likely also to improve.</p>
<p>As an email marketing it&rsquo;s also positive to see images loading by default (great for those with image-heavy templates or EDMs) and it is likely a small trade-off to lose some of the meta-data. We expect customers will see positive data from this change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Sending emails your customers <strong>want</strong> to receive is the difference between <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/10-email-marketing-campaigns-analyzed-to-increase-email-conversions/"><strong>increased email conversions</strong></a> and ending up in the trash.</p>
<p>Data gives you the power to make <strong>informed</strong> decisions. Data is what makes online marketing so powerful.</p>
<p>Here are five data-driven ways to determine what content to email your audience next.</p>
<p><span id="more-998"></span></p>
<h2>1. Ask the right questions</h2>
<p>It seems so obvious: ask your customers what they want.</p>
<p><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Qualaroo</a>, Google Forms and Wufoo all make it easy to get feedback from customers, virtually for free.</p>
<p>Qualaroo in particular makes it easy to leverage your <strong>website</strong> visitors &ndash; even those that aren&rsquo;t subscribed or signed up &ndash; in order to get ideas that will convert in your email and content campaigns.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/263?token=rdCJkdBulSPrta4tk6MFjOSs3shY9xWtfnqo3nq8Dktkm-gMSWPE8RZWhk0pJ91wGU-DftFmw0dCdaAqiZFam58"></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/264?token=FIPRL-0P4F8N72UilHrsWwG2F7vIR1x4SvN-ntxI3SHx3BpGnOwuz7smR97jUlhm25wDxONElsYrDjIZ3VFnL4w"></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/265?token=vizN0du1203ZBHK7S8y5N0eGYSGtRueVU5rTtA2ogPNs72RBetXGl4GHJZyDfRXyjL95ItfaEfwK4FLktMVWres"></p>
<p>A/B testing different questions will allow you to see what questions provide answers you can use.</p>
<p>On top of the ideas in the screenshots above, you should consider asking your readers things such as:</p>
<ul><li>How often they read your emails and content,</li>
<li>What post-styles and lengths they appreciate,</li>
<li>What suggestions for subject matter they have,</li>
<li>What you could do to increase engagement in terms of sharing and commenting.</li>
</ul><p>Ask a good mixture of <strong>open</strong> and <strong>closed</strong> questions. Leaving room for customers to provide inspiration gives great answers with previously unknown insight but can reduce response rates as they force customers to <strong>think</strong> more.</p>
<p>One trick is to use open-ended, free-form responses to guide future closed questions, allowing you to move from broad, novel responses from a single customer:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/266?token=uDqP2_dJAyk_tqngKKBfvQ9Q7ZXQ5EitWhXW8rNWL2-dOm9-BFuj_knodo0i52v1YPJnKpVtYGp68wh4rbOAHQg"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;to statistically meaningful results:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/267?token=FK2aS09Rf3l_PZktppy-9C6paoqVdZMw2w0T_bp4LQBlucSZJ0lk_5zytLYWNzQOFQQ2GERxErt-daj_bbuvonU"></p>
<p>We used this exact methodology to determine that customers wanted <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-resources/">how-to guides</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/saas-activation-lifecycle-email/">case studies</a>, both of which have already proved powerful!</p>
<h2>2. Review your support queries</h2>
<p>Your help desk is a goldmine for topics customers care about.</p>
<p>Simply reviewing a portion of your support queries in a tool like Help Scout or Zendesk can lead to insights into what you customers are asking for help with and looking for information on.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you use an intelligent Knowledge Base like <a href="http://helpjuice.com/">Helpjuice</a> you can use analytics to see popular and common topics your customers are clearly interested in.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a B2B business this can be powerful as it will help you learn what aspects of your <strong>product(s)</strong> your customers need to understand better.</p>
<p>This is usually the perfect content to use in an effective <a href="/features">email marketing campaign</a> or blog post.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building an [educational email marketing series] then your most common customer questions are the exact things you should deal with to <strong>increase your email conversions</strong>.</p>
<h2>3. Leverage other channels</h2>
<p><a href="http://stylerocks.com">StyleRocks</a> is a custom jewellery store that allows customers to style their own jewellery. Given the choice of styles available, determining which combinations and pieces to promote can be a challenge. What pieces will customers react to in aggregate?</p>
<p>Using their solid <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StyleRocks.au?fref=ts">Facebook presence</a>, StyleRocks use regular to determine styles that will result in an immediate uplift in customer attention:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/268?token=aicViFSp7AFCqn89OqtwUrzxVb0kAHLQPBM553ChmXG6iCwlorWPZdOxRn85UepNkwVc6R2zL9fCqLrl0AhECP4"></p>
<p>By acknowledging what styles work on Facebook, StyleRocks can come up with offers and promotions that are influenced by content they already know will work.</p>
<p>[Andrew Chen] and the guys at Buffer have both documented their success with a similar methodology on Twitter.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/269?token=d-vafj7IyG76_pd0oV0yNbcw9gIGTjUqHzVdeZdQoAlwXYobOGBeIIyWzxSERWu8fSN1x_onjtEyafec_vnXn1M"></p>
<p>By testing subject lines first they have been able to determine what customers actually want to hear about.</p>
<p>Getting a large response or a high number of retweets is an irrefutable sign that their content is resonating with their audience.</p>
<p>In this particular example, Andrew pre-vetted the concept behind a post that Andrew acknowledges as <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/04/27/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/">one of his most successful ever</a>.</p>
<p>This strategy can be applied across any other channel: Google+, LinkedIn, wherever your presence is strongest is a good place to look for validation of your email marketing content ideas.</p>
<h2>4. Use the world&rsquo;s index</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Keyword Tool (now known as Keyword Planner) allows you to see how popular various search terms are.</p>
<p>With a simple search you can find two things:</p>
<ul><li>Topics related to your initial idea.</li>
<li>How popular these topics are.</li>
</ul><p>Obviously keyword searches are gospel when it comes to SEO and writing for your blog but they can also be useful for determining what content you should write about and share via email at a macro level.</p>
<p>Answering questions such as people care about &lsquo;how to get customers&rsquo; at all? Do they care more than hearing about &lsquo;how to retain customers&rsquo;?</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/270?token=FPcjUTTt2NvgGuaLWBZ7m9EodcD6TRULs8kM2zy7rnrqcUvqhCTMAfQdgXTahrpvtpNrj7ADttD-7ag_aMBjrFQ"></p>
<p>The keyword planner can help you flesh out a series of topics you can use to test the waters with your audience.</p>
<p>Use this method to feed those above and you will get truly targeted results.</p>
<h2>5. Draw inspiration from the best</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration then reviewing the work of luminaries in your market is a sure-fire way to see what works.</p>
<p>If you are putting together an email series, a blog post, eBooks or other content then looking at a number of examples from the leading companies in your industry can help you determine what has already worked.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t copy</strong>. That&rsquo;s not the point at all.</p>
<p><strong>Do</strong> borrow concepts and ideas for subject areas that you can see are effective. One way to do this is to review the number of shares:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/271?token=GDHpv7xpm7kBj6hKWNkBUlGehfyHjyMjrse7RHQ0TS9-y92R3gw2JIMmnEbxpMIBdq2jbMuKOXPw-8ASz6xDp7E"></p>
<p>Ask yourself why a particular piece of content is garnering more attention. Can you leverage the same topic in your own way? Will your audience respond in a similar manner?</p>
<h2>Your turn</h2>
<p>These are a few ideas you can use to <strong>generate content for your email marketing campaigns</strong> and other content marketing that you already know will get a response: as you&rsquo;ve validated it early!</p>
<p><strong>What other ideas and methods do you have for getting customer feedback on your email marketing ideas early?</strong></p>

<html><body><p>By now you&rsquo;re an LTV optimization wizard. You know how to calculate LTV, you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of awesome email campaigns setup and you&rsquo;re keen to take things to the next level&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;but what do you do next?</p>
<p>Over the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve shared with you <strong>five</strong> campaigns to help you <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/pump-up-your-customer-ltv-with-email-remarketing/">increase your average revenue per customer</a> and <strong>seven</strong> campaigns to help you <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/pump-up-your-ltv-with-email-remarketing-increase-your-customer-lifespan-part-2-of-3/">increase your average customer lifespan</a> and decrease churn.</p>
<p><strong>This week&rsquo;s</strong> post concludes <em>this</em> series on email remarketing to increase your customer LTV. I&rsquo;m going to focus on three things today:</p>
<ol><li>A few case studies showing how segmentation leads to increased opens, clicks, conversions and profits when testing your email marketing campaigns.</li>
<li>A walkthrough on how to setup segmentation along with ideas on what attributes you should be using to segment your customers.</li>
<li>A bonus calculator that makes it super simple to calculate your average customer LTV.</li>
</ol><p>As always, this post is written to be <strong>practical</strong>. I want you to <strong>go and implement</strong> these campaigns, not just read the post!</p>
<h2>Part 3/3: Segment your users to better target and increase LTV</h2>
<h3>Segmentation works: real world case studies</h3>
<p>Intermix is an online women&rsquo;s retailer that&rsquo;s been retailing since 1993.</p>
<p>Intermix are a great example of how segmentation helps <strong>lift profits from email marketing</strong> &ndash; in this case by over 28%. Intermix got this result by <strong>decreasing the value of the discounts</strong> they were providing in their emails and <strong>increasing the average revenue per order</strong> for orders originating from email campaigns.</p>
<p>By analysing past purchasing behaviour, open and click rates and purchase order values Intermix put customers into three segments:</p>
<ol><li>VIPs &ndash; customers with higher disposable incomes that liked to shop for the latest trends.</li>
<li>Sale shoppers &ndash; these shoppers loved a discount!</li>
<li>Brand shoppers &ndash; customers that showed loyalty to particular brands. Still price conscious they are also motivated by other factors.</li>
</ol><p>Using this information, Intermix was able to <strong>dynamically adjust</strong> the offers they sent out based on an individual customer behaviour.</p>
<p><span id="more-6748"></span></p>
<p>Instead of discounts, VIPs received non-monetary offers such as invites to exclusive events or to meet the designers. In contrast sale and brand shoppers received more traditional discounts ranging from 10-15% off (for brand shoppers) to 30% off (for sale shoppers).</p>
<p>A perfect example of what segmentation is all about, this example <strong>shows us two important things </strong>we should remember when segmenting customers:</p>
<ol><li>Not all customers are equal. As I wrote in <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/pump-up-your-ltv-with-email-remarketing-increase-your-customer-lifespan-part-2-of-3/">part two</a> you will have segment that represents <strong>your </strong>VIP customers. These are the shoppers who buy from you for years, who share your brand with their friends and will even defend you if you mess up.</li>
<li>Different customers <strong>do</strong> respond to different offers. Monetary discounts aren&rsquo;t always the only way to get a response. Targeting VIP customers with other perks is a perfect example of a segmentation strategy that increases your profit margin and customer LTV.</li>
</ol><p class=" small-image" style="600px"><img title="Discount Email Marketing Examples" alt="Discount Email Marketing Examples" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/intermix1.png?resize=600%2C481" width="600" height="481"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p class="caption"><em>An example of an Intermix campaign. You can get the full details of this case study over at <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2010/03/25/e-mail-personalization-raises-revenue-at-intermix">Internet Retailer</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.totes-isotoner.com/">Totes Isotoner</a>, who sell outdoor clothing, <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2012/01/05/getting-lookers-come-back-and-buy">worked to target customers based on their previous individual browsing habits</a>. A lot of their customers spend time browsing a single product category, raincoats for example, and then leave. They had a hunch that sending their standard marketing emails featuring products from all categories was not the most effective strategy they could be using.</p>
<p>By segmenting their product update emails to be category specific, Totes Isotoner has increased their email revenues <strong>by over 7000%.</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a <strong>massive</strong> (read: ridiculous) increase!</p>
<p>Take another example from <a href="http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/">Motorcycle Superstore</a>. They harness the power of customer segmentation and use it to do two clever things in their email campaigns:</p>
<ol><li>When a customer searches for a product on their store, they <em>automatically include a widget in the next email that goes out</em> to that customer featuring the <strong>products they searched for</strong>. They only do this for customers who have searched the store in the last seven days. They are essentially segmenting customers and retargeting them with information on products they <strong>know they are individually interested in</strong>. Very savvy.</li>
<li>They automatically store a customers motorcycle as a personal data attribute. This allows Motorcycle Superstore to refer to &ldquo;<em>Your bike</em>&rdquo; in email communications and actually show information on each customers&rsquo; particular setup. These &lsquo;ads&rsquo; link to a parts page <strong>specifically designed for the motorcycle model owned by the individual customer</strong>.</li>
</ol><p>By personalising their campaigns, Motorcycle Superstore have been able to <strong>lift revenue from emails by 10%</strong>. <img title="Personalize Email Marketing for Better Results" alt="Personalize Email Marketing for Better Results" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/bigsuperstore_sml1.png?resize=630%2C1098" width="630" height="1098"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p class="caption"><em>This image and the full details of the tests are from <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/10-more-revenue-from-3">Marketing Sherpa</a>. You should definitely check it out!</em></p>
<p><strong>ALL THREE of these examples</strong> show that segmentation <strong>actually works </strong>and can have a meaningful impact on revenues generated from email marketing and the profit margin of your campaigns. The next question is&hellip;</p>
<h3>Where on earth do I begin?!</h3>
<p>Here are the <strong>five key steps</strong> to follow when segmenting customers and creating automated email campaigns that will increase your customer lifetime value. Use them as a checklist when you&rsquo;re starting out and you can&rsquo;t go wrong:</p>
<ol><li>Gather <strong>as much customer data as you can</strong> and store the data against your customer profiles. This includes customer attributes (location, acquisition channel, average order value, current lifetime) and actions (products browsed, features used, etc.). The more data you have the better you can segment.</li>
<li>Dynamically personalize your emails with customer-specific data.</li>
<li><strong>Test offers across segments</strong>. Be creative or use Intermix&rsquo;s ideas above &ndash; perhaps VIP customers respond effectively to non-monetary offers.</li>
<li>Review your <strong>results regularly</strong> and implement necessary changes to optimize your current campaigns for <strong>profitability</strong>.</li>
<li>Leave your optimized campaigns running to permanently increase your customer LTV.</li>
</ol><p>To get a little more specific, if you run an<strong> e-commerce store</strong> you should do the following:</p>
<ol><li>Automatically determine your customers&rsquo; locations using their IP address, ask for basic demographic details when customers subscribe to your email marketing list or signup to your store (including age, sex and brand preferences). Ask relevant questions, such as &ldquo;buying a gift?&rdquo;, whenever you can. Most email marketing and CRM tools let you collect customer data alongside their profile. <strong>Use this feature</strong>!</li>
<li>Track <strong>each order your customers make</strong>. Has a customer ordered once, five times or never? What is their average order value? Modern email marketing software lets you track each individual action your customers take. In most cases you can also record event variables such as purchase value. This takes away a lot of the number crunching you&rsquo;d otherwise have to do yourself.</li>
<li>Review the sorts of discounts you currently offer customers (free shipping, 10% off, 20% off) and send different discounts to each segment. <strong>A/B/C test each offer against each segment</strong> to see which combination works best.</li>
<li>Look at your conversion and revenue statistics. Adjust your campaigns such that each segment gets the most effective email content at the most effective time.</li>
<li>Watch your average customer lifespan and order value increase. <strong>Email or comment and tell me about any successes (or failures :).</strong></li>
</ol><p>Equally, if you run a<strong> SaaS business</strong> you should look out for the following:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Where did your customers come from</strong>? AdWords, Facebook, organic search, your blog? Are they active/inactive? What plan did they sign up for? Segment customers into this buckets.</li>
<li>Use your customer LTV to guide your offers and automated emails. Perhaps customers acquired via AdWords have a higher than average revenue per customer, allowing you to offer them a bigger incentive when prompting them to upgrade to annual payments. Perhaps customers who don&rsquo;t log in within the first four days of the trial are unlikely to upgrade at the end of the free trial so slowing the frequency of your welcome campaign or setting a reminder to email them personally is most appropriate.</li>
<li>Test different email copy, tone and subject lines <strong>against your different segments</strong>.</li>
<li>Look at how these new lifecycle emails affect conversion to paid plans, upgrades to higher plans and conversions to annual billing. <strong>Keep the most successful ones going.</strong></li>
<li>Watch your revenue, cash flow, and customer LTV figures. </li>
