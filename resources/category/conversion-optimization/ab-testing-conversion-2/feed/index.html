<html><body><p>As an eCommerce business, your email list is your biggest asset. It&rsquo;s the cheapest and fastest way to promote your products and cultivate a tribe of loyal customers.</p>
<p>Over and over again, email has proven to be more effective than other channels, like social media, at driving real revenue. When it comes to conversion rates, email trounces social media. In fact, it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/why_marketers_should_keep_sending_you_emails" target="_blank">40 times more effective</a> than Facebook and Twitter combined when it comes to new customer acquisition.</p>
<p>Maybe you aren&rsquo;t seeing any conversions on your emails. You send out blog posts, product recommendations, abandoned cart emails and deals to subscribers but they aren&rsquo;t buying as much as the numbers say they should.</p>
<p><strong>What gives?</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-3767"></span></p>
<p>The most likely problem is that you aren&rsquo;t testing your emails. You&rsquo;ve set up automated messages and sent the same ones over and over again, hoping that more emails will equate to more purchases. It won&rsquo;t, and it never will. But there is a solution to ineffective email marketing: <strong>A/B testing</strong>.</p>
<p>In this post we&rsquo;ll look at five things you can test in your emails and provide specific ideas to get you started.</p>
<h2>1. Delivery Time</h2>
<p>Making the sale is all about timing. You can&rsquo;t sell a computer to someone who just bought one. You can&rsquo;t sell beer to someone who just woke up (most of the time).</p>
<p>If you want customers to open your product emails and take action, you&rsquo;ll need to reach them at the right time. Too early and they&rsquo;ll relegate it to the &lsquo;read it later&rsquo; section which, let&rsquo;s face it, never gets read later. Too late and they&rsquo;ve already lost interest.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no specific time of the day, or day of the week, you should send an email. <strong>It all depends on who your customers are, when they read their emails, and when they are most likely to shop online.</strong> You&rsquo;ll need to test it out to see what works best for you.</p>
<p>Of course, the permutations and combinations are huge so have a look at the <a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/emailmarketingquarterlybenchmarkstudyq42013.pdf" target="_blank">data collected by Experian</a> as a starting point.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3770" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/ab-testing-for-email-marketers/email-marketing-day-of-week/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?fit=738%2C599&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="738,599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email-marketing-day-of-week" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?fit=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?fit=738%2C599&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3770" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png" alt="email-marketing-day-of-week" width="738" height="599" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?w=738&amp;ssl=1 738w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?resize=123%2C100&amp;ssl=1 123w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?resize=50%2C41&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/email-marketing-day-of-week.png?resize=75%2C61&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px"></p>
<p>It looks like weekends, between 8pm and 4am, are the best times and days to send emails. The open rates, click through rates, and revenue per email are higher than weekday mails. Oddly enough, the number of emails sent on weekends is considerably lower than on weekdays, meaning there&rsquo;s less competition for you.</p>
<p>Another good starting point is to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/track-your-competition/" target="_blank">subscribe to competitors&rsquo; emails</a> and note down when they send out emails. Don&rsquo;t directly copy their timing but use it as a template for your own testing.</p>
<p>Your own data might have some useful information about your customers&rsquo; habits. Look for when you have the most purchasing or browsing activity happening on your site and test delivery around those times.</p>
<p><a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/62166-five-useful-examples-of-effective-email-marketing-campaigns" target="_blank">eBags</a> looked at their email subscribers sign up times and sent emails at the same time. <strong>This led to a 20% rise in click through rates and a 65% rise in conversion rates.</strong></p>
<h2>2. Subject lines</h2>
<p>Before customers click on products in your email, they need to open it first. Since the volume of already overwhelms most people email they receive, they&rsquo;re quick to delete email that don&rsquo;t seem promising.</p>
<p>You need to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/4-steps-to-persuasive-emails/?hvid=4BHIt" target="_blank">capture their attention with your subject lines</a>. You don&rsquo;t just want them holding off on the delete button, you actually want them opening your email the moment they see it. That&rsquo;s the power of a captivating headline.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to try out in your next email campaign:</p>
<h3>Introduce Urgency</h3>
<p>Introducing urgency is a known psychological tactic used in making a sale. It tells a person that something they might want is available for a short time and that they should get it before they miss out. This works best for mails about a deal or promotion.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/whirlpool-lift-clickthrough-testing-culture" target="_blank">case study from Whirlpool</a> where they emailed customers a $400 saving on one of their product lines and tested the following subject lines for open rates:</p>
<ul><li><strong>A:</strong> Savings end soon! Save up to $400 on select Whirlpool Ice Kitchen Collections</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> Save up to $400 on select Whirlpool Ice Kitchen Collections</li>
</ul><p>Now version A is just version B with the phrase &lsquo;Savings end soon!&rsquo; prefixed to it. However, this little addition added urgency to it and resulted in higher open rates.</p>
<h3>Personalize It</h3>
<p>Personalization isn&rsquo;t just about using a customer&rsquo;s name in the subject line. It&rsquo;s about using keywords or phrases that resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>Take this <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-ab-split-test-tricks-so-good-youll-kick-yourself-youve-been-missing-out/" target="_blank">example from Vero</a>. They tested two subject lines for the same email by removing one word and switching another:</p>
<ul><li><strong>A:</strong> [Vero] The free trial ending email that works</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> The free trial ending email that converts.</li>
</ul><p>The word &lsquo;converts&rsquo; resonates more with Vero&rsquo;s CRO-focused audience and resulted in a 15% increase in opens and a 50% increase in clicks.</p>
<h3>Build Curiosity</h3>
<p>This one is obvious. If you make customers curious, they&rsquo;ll want to know more and they&rsquo;ll open your emails.</p>
<p>President <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/obama-email-campaign-testing" target="_blank">Obama&rsquo;s campaign emails</a> leveraged A/B testing to maximize their reach.. We&rsquo;ll look at it in greater detail later but for now let&rsquo;s see how A/B testing headlines increased their open rates.</p>
<p>Regular donation request emails started with &acirc;&#128;&#156;Stick with me, &lt;first name&gt;&acirc;&#128;&#157;. Short and personalized, but it doesn&rsquo;t build any curiosity. After testing multiple subject lines, they found a clear winner: &acirc;&#128;&#156;I will be outspent&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s interesting. President Obama being outspent during elections is newsworthy and it drove people to click on the email and respond to it. This single email went on to help them raise over $2.6 million.</p>
<h2>3. E-mail Design</h2>
<p>Unlike SaaS businesses, eCommerce relies heavily on the good design to make sales. So while most SaaS businesses have more success with simple plain text emails, eCommerce businesses tend perform better with image-heavy HTML mails.</p>
<p>Of course, this adds another level of complexity. Not only do you need to worry about the content, you also need to test designs and layouts. On top of that, different types of emails will require different layouts.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a new product release email from Amazon. It starts with a full-width feature section on top for the new product, with a large image, full title, product details and a captivating CTA.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3771" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/ab-testing-for-email-marketers/amazon-email-example-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?fit=864%2C789&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="864,789" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="amazon-email-example-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?fit=300%2C274&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?fit=864%2C789&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3771" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png" alt="amazon-email-example-1" width="864" height="789" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?resize=300%2C274&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?resize=110%2C100&amp;ssl=1 110w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?resize=50%2C46&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-1.png?resize=75%2C68&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px"></p>
<p>This layout places the most important product up on top and follows it up with related suggestions in case the featured product isn&rsquo;t interesting.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s their product recommendation email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3772" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/ab-testing-for-email-marketers/amazon-email-example-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?fit=864%2C912&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="864,912" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="amazon-email-example-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?fit=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?fit=864%2C912&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3772" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png" alt="amazon-email-example-2" width="864" height="912" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?resize=284%2C300&amp;ssl=1 284w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?resize=95%2C100&amp;ssl=1 95w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?resize=47%2C50&amp;ssl=1 47w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/amazon-email-example-2.png?resize=71%2C75&amp;ssl=1 71w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a list of products based on browsing history. (This is a great example of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/behavioral-email-ideas/">behavioral email</a>.) Each one might be equally interesting to the customer, so there&rsquo;s no featured area on top. They might want to test if a blurb for each product increases click through rates. Or maybe they&rsquo;ve already tested it and decided that a minimalist design sells more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/product-recommendations-email-campaign" target="_blank">Heirlume&rsquo;s</a> product recommendation emails start with text. There&rsquo;s a big CTA to read more followed by three product recommendations in a row. This new design increase click-through rates by 3% compared to their regular emails.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3773" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/ab-testing-for-email-marketers/heirloome-email-example/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?fit=837%2C1245&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="837,1245" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="heirloome-email-example" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?fit=688%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-3773 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png" alt="heirlume-email-example" width="837" height="1245" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?w=837&amp;ssl=1 837w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?resize=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1 202w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?resize=688%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 688w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?resize=67%2C100&amp;ssl=1 67w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?resize=34%2C50&amp;ssl=1 34w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heirloome-email-example.png?resize=50%2C75&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"></p>
<p>As you can see, different layouts work for different campaigns and different stores. Your audience may want a bit to read before looking at products, like Heirlume discovered, or they may just want to quickly scan products like Amazon customers. It&rsquo;s up to you to test and find out.</p>
<h2>4. Copy</h2>
<p>The Heirlume email&rsquo;s success was a result of a strong design and strategic layout but also persuasive copy. By personalizing their messages to customers, they were able to capture their interest and get them to click to learn more.</p>
<p>The Obama donation campaign understood the significance of good copy. They had a team of <em>20 writers</em> testing multiple versions of content in every email. And it paid off: they raised $50 million on the strength of persuasive content.</p>
<p>Much like subject lines, copy needs to keep a customer&rsquo;s attention long enough for them to read the whole thing and click through. If you&rsquo;re emailing about a deal, keep the urgency going. If it&rsquo;s a product recommendation email, make it personalized.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/case-study/email-marketing-repurpose-existing-content" target="_blank">Evo used content</a> to reduce returns and build up to an up-sell. They created a three-part series for customers who had just bought their ski boots (another good example of behavioral marketing).</p>
<ol><li>The first email was a guide to using their new boots. It reached customers a day after they had ordered, making it extremely relevant and highly likely that they&rsquo;ll click through and read. The aim was to familiarize customers with their new boots.</li>
<li>The second email came a few days later after customers had actually received the product in the mail. It was a guide on making the boots fit well so that customers wouldn&rsquo;t feel they got the wrong size. Again, it&rsquo;s a very relevant email.</li>
<li>Finally, after the customer has tried the boots on for a couple of days, they send an email about their ski socks. The email continues with the theme of making boots comfortable and explains how socks will enhance their experience.</li>
</ol><p><img data-attachment-id="3774" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/ab-testing-for-email-marketers/evo-example-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?fit=864%2C669&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="864,669" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="evo-example-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?fit=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?fit=864%2C669&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3774" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png" alt="evo-example-email" width="864" height="669" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?w=864&amp;ssl=1 864w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?resize=129%2C100&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/evo-example-email.png?resize=75%2C58&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px"></p>
<p>Notice how they first built trust and engagement with well-timed, relevant and personalized emails before innocuously up-selling their other product. It was a massive difference from their regular product recommendation emails and led to an increase in CTR of 904%!</p>
<h2>5. CTAs and Microcopy</h2>
<p>The call to action is the final component of your email. It&rsquo;s the critical conversion point that turns readers into website visitors and buyers. If you don&rsquo;t get this right, your entire email campaign fails.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already seen various examples of CTAs in the case studies above. Amazon has the yellow &lsquo;Learn More&rsquo; button while Evo has a large text link. Different styles work for different companies.</p>
<p>In the Whirlpool case study, the number of CTAs in the email was tested. The control email was much like Amazon&rsquo;s new product release email, with one large CTA above and three small ones below.</p>

<p>This was tested against a new version with only the top CTA. The reasoning was that fewer CTAs meant fewer distractions. This turned out to be correct and the new version increased click through rates by 42%.</p>
<p>While the shape, size and color of the buttons matter, the actual wording on them will let customers know what&rsquo;s coming. Most of the above examples use a standard &lsquo;Learn more&rsquo; but Doggyloot does something different in their cart abandonment emails.</p>

<p>The email copy is all about introducing urgency by letting customers know that the products they had in their cart are almost sold out. The button continues the theme by asking customers to restore their carts. The implied message is that if they don&rsquo;t restore it, their product will be lost. This led to a 750% increase in click through rates.</p>

<p>Now that you know what you can test and have some ideas to copy, go set up your first A/B test. Remember that the process is no different than A/B testing a website. You need to have an objective and hypothesis for each test, and you need to run them for a sufficient amount of time to get valid results.</p>
<p>Bookmark this page and come back here when you run out of testing ideas. If any of your tests lead to a big improvement in conversion rates, let us know in the comments below.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>6. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/guest-blogging" target="_blank">How We&rsquo;ve Reached More Than 1 Million People by Guest Blogging</a></strong></p>
<p>Is your time better spent writing for your own blog or someone else&rsquo;s? Rand Fishkin calls guest blogging a slippery slope, since you are giving away authority that could be your own. Groove&rsquo;s Alex Turnbull, however, suggests otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234689" target="_blank">10 of the Most Counterintuitive Pieces of Advice From Famous Entrepreneurs</a></strong></p>
<p>Advice from founders is invaluable, especially when it&rsquo;s really off the beaten path. Beth Belle Cooper asked 10 entrepreneurs for their most counterintuitive advice and uncovered some fascinating insights. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These days, however, I live without goals, for the most part. It&rsquo;s absolutely liberating, and contrary to what you might have been taught, it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop achieving things.</p>
<p>It means you stop letting yourself be limited by goals.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/improve-your-email-marketing-today/">6 Ways You Can Improve Your Email Marketing TODAY</a></strong></p>

</ul></blockquote>
<p><strong>10. <a href="http://blog.leadpages.net/landing-pages-apple-borrow-apples-best-copywriting-techniques-copy/" target="_blank">Landing Pages by Apple</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for tips on creating landing pages that convert like crazy, why not look at one of the most successful companies in the world? Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about craftsmanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about placing you, the customer, squarely in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong>11. <a href="http://blog.qz.com/post/82007790924/how-we-doubled-our-email-sign-up-rate-by-reducing" target="_blank">How we doubled our email sign-up rate by reducing friction</a></strong></p>
<p>This post appeared on Quartz, one of my favorite sites, a few months ago but it&rsquo;s a great reminder that reducing friction is one of the best ways to drive conversions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since we rolled out the new system on February 19, our daily subscriber rate has doubled, even on weekends when activity dips considerably. Users can now sign up via &ldquo;in-stream units&rdquo; (pictured above) or through the Daily Brief landing page. Of the people that view that page, a full 60% of them now go on to subscribe. In the chart below, you can see the noticeable effects these small tweaks have made to our growth.</p>

<p><strong>12. <a href="http://sparksheet.com/secret-social-network-ama-reddits-erik-martin/" target="_blank">The Secret Social Network: AMA with Reddit&rsquo;s Erik Martin</a></strong></p>
<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Last but not least, take a look at a new way to approach email. We call it lean email marketing, after the now-famous lean startup model popularized by Eric Ries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The product must be both minimal &ndash; requiring the least effort to create &ndash; and viable &ndash; functional enough that users can provide useful feedback. Rather than spending time and money perfecting a product, the lean approach gives entrepreneurs the chance to get rapid feedback, fail fast and improve quickly.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances.

With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed.

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends.

<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>

<blockquote><p>The average business person receives over 100 emails a day.

And despite the promise we all tell ourselves to unsubscribe from all of the emails you don&rsquo;t want to receive, some companies make you jump through hoops to do this, which is discouraging at best.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>You know email is a powerful marketing tool. You also know that it has been abused by careless marketers and spammers for years. One of the best ways to ensure your emails resonate with your users is to constantly A/B test factors such as subject lines, tone and copy.</p>
<h2>Making Email Better, One A/B Test at a Time</h2>
<p>This is an analysis of an A/B experiment we did with the first email campaign for our startup <a href="http://emble.io/?utm_source=EmailAB_May14_Article_VA&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=GH_01">emble.io</a> &acirc;&#128;&#148; we help you to plan get-togethers, so you can have more fun with your friends, because that&rsquo;s what life&rsquo;s about, right? And even though we aren&rsquo;t quite in beta yet, we wanted to start testing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We were keen to gather some data from the lovely people who have signed up so far, in the form of an exciting and irresistible survey. Of course, email was the most appropriate way to ask whether our prospective emblers would answer a few questions for us.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we decided to test a rather big idea on this email campaign &acirc;&#128;&#148; one that could affect how we approach marketing for our new company. We wanted to know whether our customers were more interested in a gain for them or a give to us. In other words, we used subject lines and calls to action (CTAs) to see what would drive the greatest response&acirc;&#128;&#138;&acirc;&#128;&#148;&acirc;&#128;&#138;in terms of opens, clicks and conversions&acirc;&#128;&#138;&acirc;&#128;&#148;&acirc;&#128;&#138;to find out what motivates our initial user base.</p>
<p><span id="more-2913"></span></p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what happened:</strong></p>
<p>We sent out two emails with different subject lines and primary CTAs to 498 people:</p>
<h3>A&acirc;&#128;&#138;&acirc;&#128;&#148;&acirc;&#128;&#138;Gain, aka &acirc;&#128;&#156;Jump&acirc;&#128;&#157;</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/jump-thequeue.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>B&acirc;&#128;&#138;&acirc;&#128;&#148;&acirc;&#128;&#138;Give, aka &acirc;&#128;&#156;Help&acirc;&#128;&#157;</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/help-us-out.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The carrot for each remained the same: If participants completed our super-short survey, they&rsquo;d be given earlier access to the emble beta. However, both the subject line and the CTA were different; we designed the email so that the CTA would be very prominent, and likely the first thing readers would see when they opened the email.</p>
<p>NB: We wanted to take away the carrot entirely in our B email, however, we decided that would be counterproductive because we wanted survey completes.</p>
<h2>The Race</h2>
<p>The email was sent. Our fingers were poised on the stat refresh button. At the beginning, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Jump&acirc;&#128;&#157; opened up a huge +7.3% CTR lead and pulled away on opens:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/beginning-jump.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And continued to extend up to nearly +9% CTR:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CTR-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It looked like &acirc;&#128;&#156;Help&acirc;&#128;&#157; would be trounced &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; but then it asserted itself, closing the CTR gap and overtaking on opens:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ctr-gap.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While early results in any experiment should be taken with a large pinch of salt, the wide initial variance and subsequent catch-up was still interesting to note.</p>
<h2>The Final Result</h2>
<p>With the initial excitement dissipating, we hunkered down to other work and left our two horses to race to the finish, secure in the knowledge that both emails had fought bravely to demonstrate that&acirc;&#128;&#138;, whether gain or give, &acirc;&#128;&#138;people will act readily to both types of request (this gave us a warm fuzzy feeling).</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/total-sent.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While &acirc;&#128;&#156;Jump&acirc;&#128;&#157; won in terms of creating a statistically significant larger CTR, it was great to see that &acirc;&#128;&#156;Help&acirc;&#128;&#157; elicited more opens, even though the difference wasn&rsquo;t significant enough to provide insight.</p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Jump,&acirc;&#128;&#157; therefore, inspired more action, but not by a huge amount. We thought it fantastic and inspiring to see that &acirc;&#128;&#156;Help&acirc;&#128;&#157; held its own in the end&acirc;&#128;&#138;&acirc;&#128;&#148;&acirc;&#128;&#138;what an awesome bunch we must have on our list so far!</p>
<h2>Survey Completes</h2>
<p>As a final measure, we wanted to see how the click activity fed through to the completion of the survey itself (as we consider that a conversion in this scenario), which was our main reason for the reach-out.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/survey.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you may recall, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Jump&acirc;&#128;&#157; had a +4.8% CTR over &acirc;&#128;&#156;Help&acirc;&#128;&#157;; however, it garnered a survey completion rate of +8%, which was disproportionately high compared with the CTR from the email. We know, that, on the surface, it seems like a &acirc;&#128;&#156;Well, duh&acirc;&#128;&#157; moment, but it does give nice insight into a specific group of people.</p>
<h2>Some Other Stuff We Learned</h2>
<ul><li>General Response Rate: We are hoping that we&rsquo;ll continue to get this kind of response when the beta goes live. We are delighted by this first experiment and the engagement of the awesome people who signed up.</li>
</ul><p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/open-rate.png" alt=""></p>
<ul><li>We probably distracted up to 24% of people by using secondary links, even though these weren&rsquo;t obvious. There was a good reason why we had to use them in this campaign, but we&rsquo;ll be more conscious of potential distraction in the future.</li>
<li>We got great data from the survey that will really help us in refining our marketing going forward and serving our members to the best of our ability.</li>

<p>An email like this is sent to customers after they book a flight with easyJet. The email is personalised based on the destination the customer is traveling to. I received this email myself a few months ago, so it&rsquo;s extremely relevant.</p>
<p>This is an interesting email for three reasons:</p>
<ol><li><strong>It&rsquo;s triggered by user behavior</strong>. These sorts of campaigns aren&rsquo;t discussed enough but drive a huge portion of email marketing conversions.</li>
<li><strong>There is a lot of personalised data</strong>. The email is populated with a ton of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-personalization-increases-conversions/">personalised data</a>. This is usually something that can be done better.</li>
<li><strong>easyJet send a lot of email</strong>. Thanks to the nature of their business and the opportunities for cross-sells and up-sells, easyJet send a lot of emails. It&rsquo;s always great to see what large companies with lot of resources are up to.</li>
</ol><p>So, without further ado, here are the analyses from five top email and conversion experts on what this email does well and what they&rsquo;d test to make it better.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s good about this campaign?</strong></p>
<ol><li><strong>Referring to the customer&rsquo;s individual booking in the subject line</strong> and including the booking number.Triggered transactional emails that are about something people bought consistently get high open rates. It might not be the <strong>best</strong> subject-line for this campaign but putting the booking number in there definitely seems like it&rsquo;d be effective at getting opens.</li>
<li>&acirc;&#128;&uml;&acirc;&#128;&uml;<strong>A triggered campaign based on needs</strong>: Everybody needs a place to stay while they are on travel. With this campaign, easyJet are playing on that need. A lot companies still don&rsquo;t use triggered emails to upsell around purchases. I know easyJet actually send out a series of emails, highlighting other things like premium boarding, parking space at the airport and car rental &ndash; this email shows they do a good job.</li>
<li><strong>&acirc;&#128;&uml;&acirc;&#128;&uml;Partnering up</strong>: Even though easyJet don&rsquo;t do hotel bookings themselves they teamed up with a partner to offer an additional service. Booking.com is a great match: they could even highlight this relationship more than they do in this campaign.</li>
<li><strong>Personalised, dynamic offers</strong>: The email is all about your specific destination (Berlin) which easyJet know through your booking. The offers are for double rooms, as you are travelling with two people. They are only showing hotels that aren&rsquo;t fully booked yet. I&rsquo;d bet they even use more intelligence on the back-end to align the offers to be the most likely ones you will buy<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. For instance sorting them by popularity, &acirc;&#128;&#156;most likely to appeal to couples&acirc;&#128;&#157; or &acirc;&#128;&#156;most likely to appeal to your customer profile&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</span></li>
<li><strong>They picked one selling point to highlight in the text</strong>: In this case the <em>Best Price Guarantee</em>. Seeing that easyJet is a low cost airline, price is definitely a logical starting point. It&rsquo;s not always about a guarantee; &acirc;&#128;&#156;Best hotels, lowest price&acirc;&#128;&#157; might be a better way to propose the same and is much easier to understand.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&acirc;&#128;&uml;</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Use of reviews and star scoring</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: It is hard to make a choice if you don&rsquo;t know the difference between options. Next to price they use stars to help highlight the difference between hotels, making it easier to determine which call to action you should take.</span></li>
</ol><p><strong>What would you test?</strong></p>
<ol><li><strong>The navigation bar at the top</strong>: I like an email with focus but, and this might be a surprise for most, the nav bar is definitely of influence when it comes to clicks. To get more focus on the deal, I&rsquo;d swap Hotels to the left and remove a few of the options, such as &acirc;&#128;&#156;ski breaks&acirc;&#128;&#157;. I&rsquo;d repeat this at the bottom, see which nav links get clicked on and lead to people buying and then change the options around some more. &acirc;&#128;&uml;&acirc;&#128;&uml;In all testing, but especially in email marketing, it is best to choose the winner based upon the impact on revenue: only use clicks and opens if you are not (yet) able to do that.</li>
<li><strong>Intro benefits text</strong>: The text starts with &acirc;&#128;&#156;We have&hellip;&acirc;&#128;&#157; &ndash; a big email marketing no-no! Make it about the benefits to the <strong>reader</strong>. Two of the five benefits in the intro aren&rsquo;t really benefits. The number of hotels worldwide isn&rsquo;t important if I&rsquo;m going to Berlin and no additional booking fees makes you realise they exist in the first place. &acirc;&#128;&#156;Great choice of hotels in Berlin&acirc;&#128;&#157; is the most relevant part here, so I&rsquo;d highlight that.Furthermore the colour of the intro is not ideal.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> White on orange is difficult to read. The button needs the highlighted contrast, not the block. Given that, I&rsquo;d swap the colours: make the button orange and the background a lighter colour like white or light grey. The font could be bigger and obviously testing the button text makes sense. I&rsquo;d try something like &acirc;&#128;&#156;See my Berlin offers&acirc;&#128;&#157;.</span></li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: In travel it is becoming much more common to first buy the ticket and later book a hotel. The timing is often best based on departure date and not, as you might think, on the date of purchase. The right timing depends on many factors, like the departure airport, buyer persona, when they did the booking, if it is in a weekend or not, etc, etc. So some complex testing is needed to get the timing right relative to the time the trip will be taken.</li>
<li><strong>Use of images</strong>: Images are very, very, very important in travel emails &ndash; almost as important as they are in fashion retail. But with all the hotels in their assortiment, there are a lot of images to test. A shortcut to getting more testing volume is to (also) test them on your website. Another way is to categorize the image types (exterior, interior room, one with a pool, city attractions, etc.), Find what works so you can repeat it in your emails.</li>
<li><strong>Landing pages for this campaign</strong>: The landing page related to a campaign is crucial to its success. After all, that is where people buy (or don&rsquo;t)! If they go to Booking.com there should be a reference to easyJet, making sure that people know they landed on the right page. The pages where customers land from the offers and initial button should be tested: not just their design but also whether they should be taken to a product or a category page and how the hotel filtering might appear there.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s good about this campaign?</strong></p>
<ol><li>EasyJet nail two things here: relevancy and attracting the right audience for the offer by filtering out those people that have already booked a hotel.</li>
<li>In terms of <strong>relevancy</strong>: given I&rsquo;ve just booked a flight to Berlin, receiving this follow-up trying to up-sell makes sense &ndash; it&rsquo;s extremely relevant to me as a traveller. They make this clear from the word go as the context is immediately visible in the subject line with the copy <em>&ldquo;<strong>Berlin</strong> hotels with best price guarantee&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>.</li>
<li>In terms of <strong>attracting the right audience</strong>: the subject line here reveals the email is a direct commercial offer. This will help filter out those that have already booked a hotel and are therefore less inclined to open the email. This increases the conversion rate of customers that <strong>do</strong> engage with the email.</li>
</ol><p><strong>What would you test?</strong></p>
<ol><li>I&rsquo;d include a link in the pre-header text (up top where it says <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Christopher, need a place to stay in Berlin?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>). This can be a gold mine for clicks, so it&rsquo;s a shame to miss out.</li>
<li>The main introduction text in the orange section at the top &ndash; <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Be Our Guest In Berlin&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t really stand out for me. I&rsquo;d focus on a clearer title that is benefits-focused, maybe even the text from the pre-header. I&rsquo;d include a couple of bullet points but nothing else. This section feels busy.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d feature hotels in different price ranges or categories and list more of them. With this sort of campaign there is definitely room for more images and direct calls to action.</li>
<li>All of the buttons appear to be images, I&rsquo;d replace those with HTML buttons and test the button copy to increase click-throughs. Testing button copy is always a goldmine.</li>
<li>Underneath each &ldquo;Book Now&acirc;&#128;&#157; button I&rsquo;d have a text link that says <em>&acirc;&#128;&#157;More X-star hotels&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. This lets you distinguish between categories and directs different customers to different pages depending on what they&rsquo;re looking for.</li>
<li>The best price guarantee should be explained more prominently at the top of the email. Guarantees are a good kind of proof but there is no follow-up mention of it in this email: it just says &acirc;&#128;&#156;Best price guarantee&acirc;&#128;&#157;. Can I compare prices to any other site? How do I get the guarantee? Is this from Booking.com or easyJet? etc.</li>
<li>With regards to the subject line, I would make sure to mention the booking details in the email again as well as people are expecting to see information about their booking. I think the subject line would generate a lot of opens but body content that doesn&rsquo;t match the subject line <strong>at all</strong> rarely converts as well. As the details are not in the email itself, some recipients will feel tricked into opening the email expecting to see an update on their booking&hellip;and that is not a good user experience!</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is good about this campaign?</strong></p>
<ol><li>The subject line feels a little long to me, but there are two things I think it&rsquo;s does well:<br>
a. It leverages the power of the confirmation number to get people to look and click, and<br>
b. It is personalized.</li>
<li>When a sales email uses your name in the subject line, it often feels forced; when a triggered email (or what seems to successfully masquerade as one) uses your name, it&rsquo;s appropriate because you have a relationship with that business and the campaign already.</li>
<li>The treatment of the copy is great. The preheader text does more than just tell people to view the email in their browser; it reinforces the subject line and, for those people whose email client (e.g. Gmail) shows pre-header text after the subject line, this is bound to increase opens. Also, the body copy of the email is left-aligned and isn&rsquo;t overlaid on any of the images. It&rsquo;s safe to believe that the topmost/hero copy will be readable a) on mobile devices, b) in preview windows (e.g. in Outlook) that are right- or bottom-aligned and c) when images aren&rsquo;t automatically downloaded.</li>
</ol><p><strong>What would you test?</strong></p>
<ol><li>One of the biggest things that I don&rsquo;t like here is the branding / positioning of the offer. If I was easyJet, I&rsquo;d rename what they call their &acirc;&#128;&#152;best price hotel recommendations&rsquo; service; it should sound more like a concierge or white glove offering from easyJet. Something exclusive to easyJet. Something only easyJet customers get. As it stands, the offer reads very much like what it is: a partnership between easyJet and Booking.com to squeeze more money out of customers. Not optimal. Not exclusive. Repositioning this offer as a complimentary white-glove service would be soooo easy, I want to cry.</li>
<li>The extra stuff at the bottom &ndash; everything below the 3 recommended hotels &ndash; is noise, and I&rsquo;d cut it. easyJet should know, based on what info people entered when they bought their ticket, if the recipient has special needs that require assistance, and so they should only send emails about this to people who tick that box. For the mobile stuff they could drip out a mobile-optimized email that tells people on their mobile to &lsquo;click here to get the app&rsquo; or &lsquo;click here to bookmark the mobile site&rsquo; and why they should do both. An email with the subject line &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll text you travel details day-of &ndash; just tell us these 2 things&rdquo; or something to that effect would get people who care about such a benefit to open their emails and actually do what you want them to; in this email it&rsquo;s more likely this information just distracts people from the goal of booking a hotel.</li>
<li>What does the mobile version look like? It doesn&rsquo;t look very optimised and mobile is a <strong>huge</strong> component of opens these days.</li>
<li>Can we get an email from a person, not &acirc;&#128;&#156;easyJet&rdquo;? An easy one to miss, this speaks further to the type of branding easyJet could do for this service. If this email were from Susan at easyJet Concierge Services then I might actually believe this is coming from someone real. I&rsquo;d test this designed email campaign against one where &ldquo;Susan&rdquo; from easyJet Concierge Service writes a personalized, low-design email to me with a congrats on my recently booked trip to Berlin, a few ideas where I might want to stay (including inline photos of those 3 hotels) and a request that I click a link to identify the attractions I&rsquo;ll be visiting in Berlin so she or someone from their team can recommend even better hotels to me. The whole thing could be automated but, if done right, it would feel personal and <em>exclusive</em> to easyJet.</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Find out more&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> is a lazy, high-friction call to action. No one wants to find out more. We want to <em>&ldquo;Save 18% on Berlin Hotels&acirc;&#128;&#157;, &ldquo;Book a Room in a Top-Rated Berlin Hotel&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beat the Summer Rush &ndash; Book a Room Now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Search 19,000+ Berlin Rooms in 8 Seconds or Less&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Tell Us What You Want, and We&rsquo;ll Find You a Great Room&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. Focus on the benefits!</li>
<li>A link to Google maps could help me see where these hotels are in Berlin. It&rsquo;s kinduv a big city: three randomly selected hotels are not going to scratch the surface of the average person&rsquo;s needs.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d love to see this without the images displayed. Images are becoming less of a problem for mobile device users, where images often display by default, but this email is clearly not optimized for mobile, so I don&rsquo;t think we can excuse away the importance of making sure these images, when not displaying, leave only small empty boxes and use alt text that encourages people to click to display.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is good about this campaign?</strong></p>
<ol><li>I really like this subject line with booking code. This is sure to get attention. Nicely done.</li>
<li>The entire email is extremely specific. Not just random hotels but recommendations for a particular booking based on my individual itinerary and needs. There is always room for more but, you have to admit, this email is certainly targeted at a one-to-one level.</li>
<li>It shows 3 examples for hotels you can get with ratings and prices. This sort of &acirc;&#128;&#152;digest&rsquo; approach works well here and having a variety of hotels (based on price and rating) is better than just mentioning one sort.</li>
<li>Given the digest nature of the campaign it&rsquo;s good to see plenty of calls to action to get you to click through.</li>
</ol><p><strong>What would you test?</strong></p>
<ol><li>The email starts off boring and vague: there is too much space is wasted up top. I would make the intro text more concise. I&rsquo;d cut half the text and white space in the top half of this email. You know it&rsquo;s goal from the subject line: get into it.</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Find out more&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> is a poor call to action: I have <strong>no idea</strong> at all what is waiting for me after I click. This has to be much more specific. An example that comes to mind is <em>&ldquo;See Berlin hotels available between 4-9 July&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>.</li>
<li>I would test adding calls to actions for hotel preferences: <em>&ldquo;Choose the type of hotels you want to see: [Downtown] [Budget] [Luxury]&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> and so on. This would add to the personal approach and gives another direction for people to go: taking them to a landing page where the hotels are filtered appropriately.</li>
<li>Consider changing the <em>&ldquo;Book now&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> copy on the hotel calls to action to something like <em>&ldquo;See hotel&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. I think &acirc;&#128;&#156;Book Now&acirc;&#128;&#157; is a bit premature: many recipients would not be ready to buy in an email just yet.</li>
<li>I would mention why am I shown these 3 hotels in particular. Maybe mention that one is <em>&ldquo;most popular&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>, one has <em>&ldquo;best reviews&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> and one is <em>&ldquo;best deal&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em>. This creates context I can believe in. Right now it feels a bit random, despite the hotels being targeted on Berlin.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is good about this campaign?</strong></p>
<ol><li>One of the things that I really like about this campaign is that they have partnered with Booking.com to leverage credibility and create an up-sell opportunity that they would not otherwise have had. Not only does partnering with a company as well-known add social proof but gives easyJet an amazing inventory to play with and optimise.</li>
<li>The nature of this campaign lends itself to a having a series of calls to action. I think that including a range of hotels offered, from low-end to 5-star, is a smart move and speaks to a lot of different recipients.</li>
</ol><p><strong>What would you test?</strong></p>
<ol><li><strong>Email subject</strong>: I&rsquo;m not convinced that including the reference number is the best way to get <strong>conversions</strong> out of this campaign. There is no doubt that it is going to get recipients&rsquo; attention but it seems misleading <em>and</em> there is no clear call to action in the subject itself. This leads to incongruence and that can be a killer for email conversions!</li>
<li><strong>Too many options and way too much content</strong>: the content at the top and the bottom feels distracting. It&rsquo;s not relevant and takes away from the primary call to action: to get you to view and book a hotel! I&rsquo;d pretty much cut-off the email at the &acirc;&#128;&#152;Need a hand&rsquo; section down. The top half would suffice and, I&rsquo;d imagine, removing the excess would dramatically increase conversions.</li>
<li>I think the options in the <strong>main navigation bar</strong> could be better presented elsewhere or even left out in some cases. The goal of the email is clear and, although nav bars can be effective, I&rsquo;d definitely want to test the results of removing this one. It&rsquo;d be possible to see the effects this has on direct conversions vs. how much incremental revenue is being driven by that nav bar.</li>
<li><strong>Sender Name</strong>: this email could <strong>definitely</strong> come from an individual. I&rsquo;d imagine that&rsquo;d see higher open rates, regardless of the rest of the subject line. This is a no brainer!</li>
</ol><h2 id="what-would-you-test?">What would you test?</h2>
<p>So &ndash; there you have it. There are some great ideas in here you can use for <strong>any</strong> email marketing campaign and the through-processes used by the experts are absolute gold.</p>
<p>What would you test about this campaign? Leave an idea in the comments!</p>

<html><body><p>Sending emails your customers <strong>want</strong> to receive is the difference between <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/10-email-marketing-campaigns-analyzed-to-increase-email-conversions/"><strong>increased email conversions</strong></a> and ending up in the trash.</p>
<p>Data gives you the power to make <strong>informed</strong> decisions. Data is what makes online marketing so powerful.</p>
<p>Here are five data-driven ways to determine what content to email your audience next.</p>
<p><span id="more-998"></span></p>
<h2>1. Ask the right questions</h2>
<p>It seems so obvious: ask your customers what they want.</p>
<p><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Qualaroo</a>, Google Forms and Wufoo all make it easy to get feedback from customers, virtually for free.</p>
<p>Qualaroo in particular makes it easy to leverage your <strong>website</strong> visitors &ndash; even those that aren&rsquo;t subscribed or signed up &ndash; in order to get ideas that will convert in your email and content campaigns.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/263?token=rdCJkdBulSPrta4tk6MFjOSs3shY9xWtfnqo3nq8Dktkm-gMSWPE8RZWhk0pJ91wGU-DftFmw0dCdaAqiZFam58"></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/264?token=FIPRL-0P4F8N72UilHrsWwG2F7vIR1x4SvN-ntxI3SHx3BpGnOwuz7smR97jUlhm25wDxONElsYrDjIZ3VFnL4w"></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/265?token=vizN0du1203ZBHK7S8y5N0eGYSGtRueVU5rTtA2ogPNs72RBetXGl4GHJZyDfRXyjL95ItfaEfwK4FLktMVWres"></p>
<p>A/B testing different questions will allow you to see what questions provide answers you can use.</p>
<p>On top of the ideas in the screenshots above, you should consider asking your readers things such as:</p>
<ul><li>How often they read your emails and content,</li>
<li>What post-styles and lengths they appreciate,</li>
<li>What suggestions for subject matter they have,</li>
<li>What you could do to increase engagement in terms of sharing and commenting.</li>
</ul><p>Ask a good mixture of <strong>open</strong> and <strong>closed</strong> questions. Leaving room for customers to provide inspiration gives great answers with previously unknown insight but can reduce response rates as they force customers to <strong>think</strong> more.</p>
<p>One trick is to use open-ended, free-form responses to guide future closed questions, allowing you to move from broad, novel responses from a single customer:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/266?token=uDqP2_dJAyk_tqngKKBfvQ9Q7ZXQ5EitWhXW8rNWL2-dOm9-BFuj_knodo0i52v1YPJnKpVtYGp68wh4rbOAHQg"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;to statistically meaningful results:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/267?token=FK2aS09Rf3l_PZktppy-9C6paoqVdZMw2w0T_bp4LQBlucSZJ0lk_5zytLYWNzQOFQQ2GERxErt-daj_bbuvonU"></p>
<p>We used this exact methodology to determine that customers wanted <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-resources/">how-to guides</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/saas-activation-lifecycle-email/">case studies</a>, both of which have already proved powerful!</p>
<h2>2. Review your support queries</h2>
<p>Your help desk is a goldmine for topics customers care about.</p>
<p>Simply reviewing a portion of your support queries in a tool like Help Scout or Zendesk can lead to insights into what you customers are asking for help with and looking for information on.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you use an intelligent Knowledge Base like <a href="http://helpjuice.com/">Helpjuice</a> you can use analytics to see popular and common topics your customers are clearly interested in.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a B2B business this can be powerful as it will help you learn what aspects of your <strong>product(s)</strong> your customers need to understand better.</p>
<p>This is usually the perfect content to use in an effective <a href="/features">email marketing campaign</a> or blog post.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building an [educational email marketing series] then your most common customer questions are the exact things you should deal with to <strong>increase your email conversions</strong>.</p>
<h2>3. Leverage other channels</h2>
<p><a href="http://stylerocks.com">StyleRocks</a> is a custom jewellery store that allows customers to style their own jewellery. Given the choice of styles available, determining which combinations and pieces to promote can be a challenge. What pieces will customers react to in aggregate?</p>
<p>Using their solid <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StyleRocks.au?fref=ts">Facebook presence</a>, StyleRocks use regular to determine styles that will result in an immediate uplift in customer attention:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/268?token=aicViFSp7AFCqn89OqtwUrzxVb0kAHLQPBM553ChmXG6iCwlorWPZdOxRn85UepNkwVc6R2zL9fCqLrl0AhECP4"></p>
<p>By acknowledging what styles work on Facebook, StyleRocks can come up with offers and promotions that are influenced by content they already know will work.</p>
<p>[Andrew Chen] and the guys at Buffer have both documented their success with a similar methodology on Twitter.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/269?token=d-vafj7IyG76_pd0oV0yNbcw9gIGTjUqHzVdeZdQoAlwXYobOGBeIIyWzxSERWu8fSN1x_onjtEyafec_vnXn1M"></p>
<p>By testing subject lines first they have been able to determine what customers actually want to hear about.</p>
<p>Getting a large response or a high number of retweets is an irrefutable sign that their content is resonating with their audience.</p>
<p>In this particular example, Andrew pre-vetted the concept behind a post that Andrew acknowledges as <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/04/27/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/">one of his most successful ever</a>.</p>
<p>This strategy can be applied across any other channel: Google+, LinkedIn, wherever your presence is strongest is a good place to look for validation of your email marketing content ideas.</p>
<h2>4. Use the world&rsquo;s index</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Keyword Tool (now known as Keyword Planner) allows you to see how popular various search terms are.</p>
<p>With a simple search you can find two things:</p>
<ul><li>Topics related to your initial idea.</li>
<li>How popular these topics are.</li>
</ul><p>Obviously keyword searches are gospel when it comes to SEO and writing for your blog but they can also be useful for determining what content you should write about and share via email at a macro level.</p>
<p>Answering questions such as people care about &lsquo;how to get customers&rsquo; at all? Do they care more than hearing about &lsquo;how to retain customers&rsquo;?</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/270?token=FPcjUTTt2NvgGuaLWBZ7m9EodcD6TRULs8kM2zy7rnrqcUvqhCTMAfQdgXTahrpvtpNrj7ADttD-7ag_aMBjrFQ"></p>
<p>The keyword planner can help you flesh out a series of topics you can use to test the waters with your audience.</p>
<p>Use this method to feed those above and you will get truly targeted results.</p>
<h2>5. Draw inspiration from the best</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration then reviewing the work of luminaries in your market is a sure-fire way to see what works.</p>
<p>If you are putting together an email series, a blog post, eBooks or other content then looking at a number of examples from the leading companies in your industry can help you determine what has already worked.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t copy</strong>. That&rsquo;s not the point at all.</p>
<p><strong>Do</strong> borrow concepts and ideas for subject areas that you can see are effective. One way to do this is to review the number of shares:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/271?token=GDHpv7xpm7kBj6hKWNkBUlGehfyHjyMjrse7RHQ0TS9-y92R3gw2JIMmnEbxpMIBdq2jbMuKOXPw-8ASz6xDp7E"></p>
<p>Ask yourself why a particular piece of content is garnering more attention. Can you leverage the same topic in your own way? Will your audience respond in a similar manner?</p>
<h2>Your turn</h2>
<p>These are a few ideas you can use to <strong>generate content for your email marketing campaigns</strong> and other content marketing that you already know will get a response: as you&rsquo;ve validated it early!</p>
<p><strong>What other ideas and methods do you have for getting customer feedback on your email marketing ideas early?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>You&rsquo;re probably sitting there thinking &lsquo;<em>A/B testing my emails is <strong>too hard</strong></em>&lsquo;, &lsquo;<em>I don&rsquo;t have <strong>enough people</strong> to bother</em>&lsquo; or &lsquo;<em><strong>where do I even start</strong>?</em>&lsquo;</p>
<p>Right&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;right?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty normal: not enough online businesses A/B test their email campaigns! So <strong>be different</strong>: it&rsquo;s not hard and by doing so you&rsquo;ll stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Here are three examples of <strong>subject line A/B split tests</strong> from real world businesses that have actionable results.</p>
<p>Each test employs some email marketing tricks. Let&rsquo;s break &acirc;&#128;&#152;em down one-by-one so <b>you </b>can harness their power when doing your own testing!</p>
<p><span id="more-650"></span></p>
<h2>1. Be afraid, be <em>very</em> afraid: use the power of fear.</h2>
<p>People <strong>hate</strong> missing out.</p>
<p>We hate it so much we <strong>fear</strong> it.</p>
<p>This fear is innate and psychologically <em>very</em> powerful.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that people remember and engage <em>based on their feelings</em> and you have a strong case for embracing fear.</p>
<p>As this great presentation describes, emotions are part of a great story and a great story is great marketing (check out slide 33).</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="427" height="356" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/10626156?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>You need to make your customers <strong>feel</strong> what you&rsquo;ve got to say.</p>
<p>This email from Thanh over at <a href="http://asianefficiency.com/">Asian Efficiency</a> is a simple, but effective, example.</p>
<p>A massive A/B tester, Thanh has found time-and-again that subject lines that make the customer feel as though they&rsquo;re missing out <strong>work extremely well</strong>.</p>
<p>Take a look at this recent campaign Thanh sent out on improving your sleeping patterns to improve efficiency.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Email A/B split test embrace fear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/embrace-fear-ab-split-testing-email1.png"></p>
<p>Of the four variations the winning subject line was undoubtedly <em>&ldquo;The invisible trick to get more energy and stuff done&rdquo;</em> &ndash; it was the <strong>most effective by 24%</strong>.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><a href="http://copyhackers.com/2013/01/write-sticky-copy-that-gets-noticed/">This article</a> from Joanna over at CopyHackers enforces the notion of making your customers <em>feel</em>.</p>
<p>Similar to subject lines, Joanna breaks down some great landing page headlines and suggests some alternate (read: much better) variations. You&rsquo;ll notice that most of the improved headlines employ a heavy element of fear. For example:</p>
<p><em>Crisis narrowly averted</em> vs. <em>Find Your Next Job Now &ndash; Before You Get Sacked</em>.</p>
<p>Which one do you think would have a bigger impact?</p>
<p>The latter!</p>
<p>Why? It embraces fear and makes the reader <strong>feel</strong> the pain.</p>
<p><strong>The point:</strong> Embrace fear when writing your subject lines.</p>
<h2>2. Ask why&hellip;don&rsquo;t tell them how</h2>
<p>This test comes from the guys over at <a href="http://strikingly.com">Strikingly.com</a>.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Ask why not how" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ask-questions-striking.ly_.png"></p>
<p>The subject line was tested in these two emails and, over time and many hundreds of emails the first variation, with subject line <em>Why Stay Competitive on Mobile</em> influenced opens and clicks by <strong>just over 10%</strong> in both cases.</p>
<p>The body of each email was exactly the same, the influence was all in the subject.</p>
<p>Simon Mainwaring over at <a href="http://simonmainwaring.com/brands/the-%E2%80%98why%E2%80%9D-vs-%E2%80%9Chow%E2%80%9D-what-makes-some-brands-extraordinary-and-others-not/">WeFirst</a> writes about the &lsquo;how&rsquo; vs. the &lsquo;why&rsquo; when it comes to branding and marketing.</p>
<p>His point is simple: people need to <strong>understand the why</strong> before making a decision.</p>
<p>As humans we don&rsquo;t just do things because we&rsquo;re told to, we need to understand why we should do them!</p>
<p>This A/B test proves this holds true when it comes to writing your subject lines.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why&rsquo; is also a <em>question word</em>. It generally precedes a question and asks people to think something through.</p>
<p>Questions are powerful in and of themselves. Anecdotally, the guys at Striking.ly have found that whenever they include a direct question as a call to action at the end of an email, particularly a personal one from David the founder, they get an <strong>overwhelming</strong> response.</p>
<p>They recently did this as part of their welcome email (a cool tactic discussed more in my post discussing <a href="http://conversionxl.com/how-your-customers-actually-read-your-emails/">how customers actually read your emails</a>) and it was <strong>so successful</strong> they had to turn it off as they couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the responses!</p>
<p><strong>The point:</strong> communicate the &lsquo;why&rsquo; with your customers. Ask them the question and let them convince themselves of the answer and your marketing will be much more effective.</p>
<h2>3. BOOM! Use impact words (oh, and be personal)</h2>
<p>This is a test that&rsquo;s been running for a good while now at Vero.</p>
<p>The campaign, sent on day four of the free trial, aims to educate new customers about what they can do with lifecycle emails.</p>
<p>Out of these two, which do you think wins?</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Use power words email marketing split test" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/use-impact-words-vero-subjects.png"></p>
<p>Ding, ding, ding&hellip;number two takes the lead by a massive <strong>15% for the open rate</strong> and <strong>50% for the click through rate</strong>.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Impact words convert better" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vero-results.png"></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be interested to note that the content in these emails is <strong>exactly the same</strong>, it&rsquo;s just the subject line that changed.</p>
<p>There are two things going on here:</p>
<ol><li>The first variation is <em>much</em> less personal. Although generally useful to remind customers of WHO is sending the email this is better achieved with the <em>from name</em>, something along the lines of &lsquo;Chris from Vero&rsquo;.</li>
<li>The second version has <strong>purpose</strong>. The word <strong>converts</strong> resonates much stronger with the Vero audience than the word <strong>works</strong>, whatever that even means ;).</li>
</ol><p>The guys at HelpScout mention in their <a href="https://www.helpscout.net/infographics/10things/">10 Things Your Customers With You Know About Them</a> feature that customers will remember you if you remember their names.</p>
<p>The point is that personalization and making a connection are vital to engagement. This explains why removing the cold &lsquo;[Vero]&rsquo; from the subject contributes to the uplift in opens.</p>
<p>Similarly, this example from Dan Norris at <a href="http://inform.ly/">Inform.ly</a> comes from an update to his blog mailing list:<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dan-norris-use-impact-words-improved.png"><img alt="dan-norris-use-impact-words-improved" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dan-norris-use-impact-words-improved.png" width="1108" height="158"></a>Dan has tested the use of the word &lsquo;hack&rsquo; &ndash; a topical, &lsquo;impact&rsquo; word &ndash; against the less direct &lsquo;simple secret&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Using the term &lsquo;hack&rsquo; increased <strong>click throughs</strong> by <strong>28%</strong>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a convincing win in my book!</p>
<p><strong>The point:</strong> Next time you&rsquo;re writing a subject line give it <strong>impact</strong>. Use words with purpose and watch your results sky rocket!</p>
<h2>Over to you</h2>
<p>What A/B tests have you tried and seen work? Why do you think these tips and tricks would or would not work for your mailing list?</p>
