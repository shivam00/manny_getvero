<html><body><p>How are <strong>you</strong> going to become a better email marketer in 2015?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty out there on <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">email strategy</a> but the success of an email campaign largely depends on the skill and knowledge of the person executing it.</p>
<p>The tips in this post are things you can do improve yourself. Take ownership of your growth as a marketer and kill it this year. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>1. Create a swipe file.</h2>
<p>A swipe file is the best way to keep track of inspiration.</p>
<p>When you receive a great email, use Gmail Labels, Evernote or <a href="https://litmus.com/scope/" target="_blank">Litmus Scope</a> to save it for later. That way, you&rsquo;ll have a reservoir of inspiration when the time comes to write your next email.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/swipe-file-example.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><a style="background: #55acee; border-bottom-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 3px; border-radius: 4px; color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0; padding: 11px 20px 9px; text-decoration: none;" title="Tweet This Tip" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.twitter.com%2Fresources%2Fbuttons&amp;text=Email%20tip%20%231.%20Create%20a%20swipe%20file.%2024%20more%20here%3A&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.getvero.com%2Fmaster-email-marketing%2F&amp;via=getvero" target="_blank">Tweet This Tip</a></p>
<h2>2. Extend your email address for easy filtering.</h2>
<p>Did you know that you can extend your Gmail address? Just add a &ldquo;+&rdquo; then a keyword when subscribing to newsletters.</p>
<p>For example, I use &ldquo;jimmy+newsletters@getvero.com&rdquo; to subscribe to newsletters just for my swipe file. Then, I filter emails to that address to be marked as read, archived and labeled.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="328px"><img data-attachment-id="5323" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/master-email-marketing/gmail-extend/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?fit=328%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="328,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gmail extend" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?fit=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?fit=328%2C198&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5323" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=328%2C198" alt="gmail extend" width="328" height="198" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?w=328&amp;ssl=1 328w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=166%2C100&amp;ssl=1 166w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gmail-extend.png?resize=75%2C45&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<h2>3. Subscribe to a lot of email newsletters.</h2>
<p>If you want to send great emails, it&rsquo;s a good idea to subscribe to tons of newsletters to 1) build up your swipe file and 2) see which tactics work and which really stink.</p>
<p>We created a list of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-email-newsletters/">50 great email newsletters here</a> but that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. Don&rsquo;t hold back &hellip; signup for tons of newsletters but filter them into an archive for easy reference and minimal inbox disruption.</p>
<p>Check out tools like <a href="http://letterlist.com/" target="_blank">Letterlist</a> and <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/#!/s/posts/newsletters" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a> to find new newsletters.</p>

<h2>4. Signup for lots of products in your industry.</h2>
<p>Keep track of your competitors by subscribing to their emails and signing up for their product or service. Make sure you are receiving their newsletters and promotional email as well as their onboarding and lifecycle email.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to make a &ldquo;Competitors&rdquo; folder in <a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a> to keep track of their blogs and monitor Product Hunt for newbies in your field.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="436px"><img data-attachment-id="5325" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/master-email-marketing/product-hunt-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?fit=436%2C320&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="436,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="product hunt" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?fit=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?fit=436%2C320&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5325" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?resize=436%2C320" alt="product hunt" width="436" height="320" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?w=436&amp;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?resize=136%2C100&amp;ssl=1 136w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?resize=50%2C37&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/product-hunt.png?resize=75%2C55&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><a style="background: #55acee; border-bottom-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 3px; border-radius: 4px; color: #fff; display: inline-block; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0; padding: 11px 20px 9px; text-decoration: none;" title="Tweet This Tip" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.twitter.com%2Fresources%2Fbuttons&amp;text=Email%20tip%20%234.%20Signup%20for%20lots%20of%20products%20in%20your%20industry.%2024%20more%20here%3A&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.getvero.com%2Fmaster-email-marketing%2F&amp;via=getvero" target="_blank">Tweet This Tip</a></p>
<h2>5. Signup for lots of products NOT in your industry.</h2>
<p>I find that I&rsquo;m most inspired by emails sent by businesses outside the email industry. For that reason, I signup for all kinds of apps and service just to see what kind of emails they send.</p>
<p>Pinterest, for example, sends a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/saas-onboarding-emails/">great onboarding series</a> which has inspired our own onboarding emails.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/26225?token=Bt5doIqhjQah5tPBTRAo14oLqfK-TEcY7ON9b9td9nvinbnk_Cs10WhBXbNsL4DR0q22E1X0nQAX4KvNsidmv6M" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-26 13.54.26.png"></p>

<h2>6. Write the world&rsquo;s best welcome email.</h2>
<p>Imagine that NASA is sending a rocket to the moon. If the rocket is one degree off at launch, it&rsquo;s going to miss the moon by a zillion miles. Their aim better be really good. (I&rsquo;m no scientist but you get my point.)</p>
<p>Your welcome email is the same way. Make it damn good so you end up on the moon and not Mars.</p>

<h2>7. Don&rsquo;t be distracted by A/B testing.</h2>
<p>If you were building a house, would you worry about what color to paint the bathroom before digging the foundation?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing if you&rsquo;re A/B testing subject lines and button copy before building complete onboarding and lifecycle campaigns. Getting those in place is paramount to using email successfully.</p>
<p>Until then, A/B testing is simply a distraction.</p>

<h2>8. Practice copywriting in Hemingway App.</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t write like an English major, write like a journalist.</p>
<p>Business writing needs to clear, simple and succinct. &ldquo;Prose&rdquo; is never a word you should associate with marketing copy.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a> to keep you honest. This awesome tool helps you avoid run-on sentences, adverbs and big words.</p>

<h2>9. Send plain-text emails.</h2>
<p>Beautiful email templates are bad for your business. <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-templates-hurt-business/">Nathan Barry</a> explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best way to market online is to teach, to regularly deliver valuable content to your audience so that they will trust you and eventually want to purchase from you. So when you send an email, what part of the communication delivers the most value?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the content. So we should be stripping away everything else that isn&rsquo;t necessary in order to focus on the content. Multi-column layouts, background images, logos, and all the other nonsense that typically fills marketing emails doesn&rsquo;t deliver value to the recipient. Instead it is all about you, the sender.

<h2>10. Build a foundation of lifecycle emails.</h2>
<p>One of the many issues with promotional emails and newsletters is that you can only use them once.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">Lifecycle emails</a>, on the other hand, are used over and over again. This is awesome because you can do the work once and get value from it for a long time and you can actually optimize it since it will be triggered again soon.</p>
<p>Read Samuel Hulick&rsquo;s great post on Help Scout for a <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/blog/lifecycle-emails/" target="_blank">perfect explanation of lifecycle email</a>.</p>

<h2>11. Unsubscribe people before they do it themselves.</h2>
<p>Want to improve your open rates? Email people who actually care.</p>
<p>If someone hasn&rsquo;t opened your emails in six months, remove them from your list. Consistently sending emails that aren&rsquo;t opened is a good way to earn a reputation as a spammer.</p>
<p>Plus, it&rsquo;s considerate which is a business trait we should all emphasize more anyway.</p>

<h2>12. Do a survey.</h2>
<p>When people subscribe to the Vero blog, we send them 12-step email campaign over the course of about three months. Two of those emails are surveys that help us gather feedback about our content.</p>
<p>We have learned SO much from that survey. Much of the feedback is qualitative but it&rsquo;s hugely important to know who is reading our blog and what they think about it.</p>
<p>Here is an example: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PTC8Z95" target="_blank">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PTC8Z95</a></p>

<h2>15. Go all-in on H2H.</h2>
<p>Speaking of Greg Ciotti, he has mastered the &ldquo;human-to-human&rdquo; writing tone.</p>
<p>Write emails like you are speaking to one person. Forget B2B and B2C. Focus on H2H.</p>
<p>When I get emails from Greg, I don&rsquo;t differentiate between personal and professional correspondence. Whether he sent the email just to me or to Help Scout&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/list-growth/" target="_blank">60,000 subscribers</a>, it feels the same because he uses a conversational tone.</p>
<p>Every email you send is personal. And every email you send is marketing.</p>

<h2>16. Read your emails out loud.</h2>
<p>Baremetrics founder Josh Pigford recently started turning his <a href="https://baremetrics.io/blog" target="_blank">blog posts</a> into a podcast called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/founders-journey/id957952675">Founder&rsquo;s Journey</a> simply by reading them out loud.</p>
<p>This is incredibly smart because it&rsquo;s an easy way to repurpose content but it&rsquo;s also a great way to hone your writing. After seeing this, I started reading my emails and blog posts out loud before publishing them.</p>

<h2>17. Treat onboarding like a newborn baby.</h2>
<p>Most parents don&rsquo;t leave their newborn babies outside overnight to toughen them up. Instead, they cater to their every need &ndash; feeding them at all hours of the day and night, changing their diapers and taking lots of pictures to remember those special moments.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much exactly how you should treat your <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/saas-onboarding-emails/">onboarding</a>.</p>
<p>When someone news signs up, use onboarding emails to gently coo them from a wide-eyed newborn to an ass-kicking customer.</p>

<h2>18. Tell people exactly how often to expect emails.</h2>
<p>Setting expectations is really important with email marketing. If someone signs up for your weekly newsletter but you send emails three times a week, they are going to unsubscribe.</p>
<p>Tell people upfront how often they should expect to receive emails.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Product Hunt sets expectations for their (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/product-hunt/">addictive</a>) daily email:</p>

<h2>19. Use the 1-2-3 Method.</h2>
<p>When email fails, it&rsquo;s often because the sender didn&rsquo;t make it abundantly clear what the recipient should do next. The 1-2-3 Method (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/1-2-3-method/">explained in greater detail here</a>) ensures that will never happen again.</p>
<p>The 1-2-3 Method looks like this:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Twitter-Lifecycle-Email.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do next:</p>
<ul><li>Thing 1</li>
<li>Thing 2</li>
<li>Thing 3</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>You can only choose three things so make them count!</p>

<h2>20. Use the Inverted Pyramid Method.</h2>
<p>The Inverted Pyramid Method is a good way to ensure that your emails aren&rsquo;t distracting.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in a &ldquo;too many cooks in the kitchen&rdquo; situation, help stakeholders focus on the purpose of email marketing. Design, copy and content can actually interfere with email marketing! Use this guide minimize distractions and send tight, focused emails.</p>

<h2>21. Commit to sending one really great behavioral email.</h2>
<p>I know, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/convert-with-behavioral-email/">behavioral email</a> is intimidating if you aren&rsquo;t a techie. But let me assure you that I&rsquo;m no techie and even I can send behavioral emails.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in e-commerce, start with an abandoned shopping cart email.</p>

<h2>22. Create a personal newsletter.</h2>
<p>I did this recently as an experiment and am already learning some important lessons. (You can subscribe here: <a href="http://swipefile.co/" target="_blank">SwipeFile.co</a>.)</p>
<p>For example, when you aren&rsquo;t the founder of a business, you can sometimes hide behind a veil of anonymity. Maybe you create emails that are &ldquo;sent&rdquo; from your CEO or maybe you create emails that are just &ldquo;from&rdquo; the company.</p>
<p>When the email is yours and yours alone, you pore over every word in hopes of perfecting your email. Ownership of an email will help you learn to write like a human and send way better emails at your day job.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://goodbits.io/">Goodbits</a>, <a href="http://curated.co/">Curated</a> and <a href="http://tinyletter.com/" target="_blank">TinyLetter</a> to see how easy curation can be. Additionally, you can create a second project in Vero to keep professional and personal email separate.</p>

<h2>24. Don&rsquo;t give up.</h2>
<p>Just like content marketing, email marketing needs time.</p>
<p>You need to grow a list, earn their trust, build an onboarding series, create <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a> and so much more. It takes a long time. Don&rsquo;t give up when the going gets tough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>When it comes time to survey your email subscribers, most marketers look to Google Forms or SurveyMonkey. These are useful tools but both have one major disadvantage: they require the user to leave the email, then take the survey.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nicer if they could take simple surveys right in the email, regardless of their mail platform? After all, removing friction from the conversion process is one of the pillars of CRO.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way. We discovered a tool called <a href="http://www.clickinsights.io/">ClickInsights</a> on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/clickinsights">ProductHunt</a> recently that makes surveys easier than ever. Although it hasn&rsquo;t officially launched, we got early access and thought we&rsquo;d show you how it works.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> Do you get the Product Hunt newsletter? <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank">Sign up</a>, it&rsquo;s pure gold.</em></p>
<h2>How to Get Meaningful Data from Surveys</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20144?token=TQ0j4OFK0qc5j-LOYDAyT6Jeb-svRrlpd14TAliIhlV3UsBulHzySR3nr4wpEpaAr8H-WUHQUqj0SUQDvdi4EEQ" alt="results.jpg"></p>
<p>When it comes to surveys, simple is key. If you create too many steps or ask for too much of your users&rsquo; time, they are going to ignore you (and who could blame them?).</p>
<p>Step #1 for creating a successful survey is defining <em>exactly</em> what you hope to get out of it. So instead of asking someone, &ldquo;Will you answer 10 questions about your experience with our company?&rdquo;, consider asking, &ldquo;Are you likely to recommend this product to a friend?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The difference is that you will get more feedback and more specific data. You can also follow up individually with people who said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>Creating Surveys with ClickInsights</h2>
<p>One of the best parts of ClickInsights is that there are no distractions. The interface is clean and simple. To get started, just click &ldquo;Create a Survey&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20145?token=_jZYbG5VwsNTEkZSWboZrYp4EopjvHY81bMy6Qv4J_R6d1tljK2BKIMhAl7IRo45aK6GZFjYuHCUYvwfoOsj28M" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.04.57.png"></p>
<p>You get one question, so make it a good one. (You could, however, easily create multiple questions and include them in the same email. The only problem with this is that when the user clicks a link, they leave their mail client.) All questions are multiple choice and you can choose whether or not you will allow people to comment after clicking.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20147?token=aQLEaN36JmYWE17TwNzj0ihNDKNUcfM_creDaPR-tV0CNbhJF_1cCmueeSncBUp3-gQsuIutj5rsSBq51-J9PBg" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.09.40.png"></p>
<p>There is an option to integrate the data with your email service provider. (Vero will be a launch partner!)</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20148?token=-eht_dSEVULfmeJblNBRghhm7VJhI3H9pV4yBlFfGfd3QrfmQhDIiilrIvUBUIjCI8c3HTkVl7jf9a8N4ch2cUg" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.12.47.png"></p>
<p>The last option is creating the &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; message.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20149?token=D658sBBUV9joBPdNV2GvSbWTDbMLJ3tP6EahYx7P-_P2mnJS63DDdbac4VSIhVX-OJyE3U5Z87gNLXWsghAXQ_0" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.14.18.png"></p>
<p>After that, just create the form and paste the HTML code into your email. Users will be able to click the appropriate answer and ClickInsights will collect the data.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20150?token=JmA1WhVdQ9hn-jdeVCK_vDM1SFPMTzQrmoWiGQF9yky22vshLyEQcb_J6WpveIJ2X30FYGb36iUQvqHQ37M0WiA" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.16.50.png"></p>
<p>Vero users can even create and track events based on the survey answers. This will allow you to send follow-up emails automatically. You can even embed the surveys into blog posts, which I&rsquo;ve done here:</p>
<h3>Would you recommend our blog to a friend?</h3>
<h4><a href="http://app.clickinsights.io/thank-you/53ff9bfb124a8dff698b456fo0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.first_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.last_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.email%7D%7Do0attrs0o_*1o0attrs0ofirst/">Yes</a></h4>
<h4><a href="http://app.clickinsights.io/thank-you/53ff9bfb124a8dff698b456fo0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.first_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.last_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.email%7D%7Do0attrs0o_*1o0attrs0osecond/">No</a></h4>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! Pretty awesome, right? You <a href="http://clickinsights.io/">request access to the beta</a> here. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/tony_hill" target="_blank">Tony Hill</a> for the early access!)</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Last week on the <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/get-more-email-subscribers-how-we-doubled-email-signups" target="_blank">Buffer blog</a>, Kevan Lee wrote something that really resonated with us here at Vero.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve got this idea about email marketing, and it goes something like this:</p>
<ul><li>Create amazing content that people want to read all the time</li>
<li>Ask permission to send amazing content to people&rsquo;s emails.</li>
<li>Ask again.</li>
<li>Ask a couple more times.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to turn the conversion process into rocket science when it can actually be dead simple. The key, of course, is building a foundation with great content so people will by itching to act when you ask them to subscribe to your emails. Then, it really is as simply as just asking permission to keep the conversation going.</p>
<p><span id="more-3815"></span></p>
<h2>How to Grow Your Email List (the Easy, Simple and Free Way)</h2>
<p>There are so many ways to grow your email list. You can leverage one of the hundreds of plugins available, use <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/twitter-lead-generation-cards/">Twitter Lead Generation cards</a>, retargeting ads and even PPC. In fact, there are so many options that we often it&rsquo;s easy to get distracted by all of them.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you need something <strong>quick, easy and effective</strong>. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve recently moved to <a href="http://sumome.com/app/scroll-box">Scroll Box from SumoMe</a> to collect email addresses on the blog. If you&rsquo;ve scrolled down this page at least halfway, you&rsquo;ll see it in the bottom right corner. (Our emails rock and <a href="https://my.leadpages.net/leadbox/14000b173f72a2%3A14a51463ab46dc/5649391675244544/">you can sign up for them here</a>.)</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MhFwAJKwI_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to show you exactly how we setup ScrollBox to add 575 email addresses to our list since June. Have questions? Just let us know in the comments.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Get SumoMe</h2>
<p>WordPress users can simply use the plugin while others can embed a snippet of HTML code into the &lt;head&gt; section of their website. It takes just a few minutes to do and once your account is registered, you just need to verify your Site ID number in WordPress or in the HTML code.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3819" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grow-your-email-list/sumome-site-id-800/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?fit=800%2C91&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,91" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sumome-site-id-800" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?fit=300%2C34&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?fit=800%2C91&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3819" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png" alt="sumome-site-id-800" width="800" height="91" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?resize=300%2C34&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?resize=50%2C6&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-id-800.png?resize=75%2C9&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>Step 2: Install Scroll Box</h2>
<p>Controlling SumoMe apps like Scroll Box is a bit different than most other plugins. Instead of managing it on the backend of your site, you manage it on the front end.</p>
<p>From any page on your site, you can access the Admin settings by hovering over the little blue line in the top right corner. When you hover over it, it pops out so you can click and login. If you have any trouble finding the blue line, just open your site in Incognito mode.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="400px"><img data-attachment-id="3820" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grow-your-email-list/sumome-site-badge/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sumome-site-badge" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?fit=400%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3820" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png" alt="sumome-site-badge" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumome-site-badge.png?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a screen like this. Head to the Sumo store to install Scroll Box. Once installed, you&rsquo;ll access and manage it through this same interface.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="414px"><img data-attachment-id="3821" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grow-your-email-list/sumomeapps/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?fit=414%2C323&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="414,323" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sumome-apps" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?fit=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?fit=414%2C323&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3821" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png" alt="sumome-apps" width="414" height="323" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?w=414&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?resize=300%2C234&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?resize=128%2C100&amp;ssl=1 128w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sumomeapps.png?resize=75%2C59&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px"></p>
<h2>Step 3: Setup Your Scroll Box</h2>
<p>There are a number of things you can control from the Settings panel but SumoMe does a good job of keeping this area simple. By not allowing you to spend tons of time customizing the app, they force you to set it up, tweak it and forget it.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="518px"><img data-attachment-id="3822" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grow-your-email-list/scrollbox-settings/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?fit=518%2C413&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="518,413" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scrollbox-settings" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?fit=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?fit=518%2C413&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3822" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png" alt="scrollbox-settings" width="518" height="413" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?resize=125%2C100&amp;ssl=1 125w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?resize=50%2C40&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/scrollbox-settings.png?resize=75%2C60&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px"></p>

<p>If you are using an email platform that integrates directly with Scroll Box, this is the fastest way to add a call to action.</p>
<p>As you craft your copy and call to action, remember to:</p>

<p>Everyone will need to configure this section. The trigger percent allows you decide when your readers will see the Scroll Box. We have ours set to 50% but it&rsquo;s a good idea to test different percentages to maximize value.</p>
<p>You can also choose where it appears, how it enters the screen and how often people should see it.</p>

<p>This is where Vero users can connect Scroll Box with their own email database. Use HTML to create the the content for the box. Next, create a form using Vero&rsquo;s form builder and embed the code underneath your call to action.</p>
<p>In this section, you can also choose whether mobile users see the Scroll Box, which pages should be excluded and what happens after someone enters their email.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! It&rsquo;s super simple and highly effective. If you have any questions about integrating Scroll Box with Vero, just let us know in the comments or <a href="mailto:support@getvero.com">email our support team</a>.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>As you automate your marketing with triggered emails, scheduled tweets and regular content on your blog, don&rsquo;t forget about automating the tracking of your competitors. There are a number of cool ways to track your competitors in Google, social media and even email marketing. In this post, we&rsquo;ll outline the tools and tips to make this happen with as little effort as possible.</p>
<p>Ready to get started?</p>
<h2>Email Marketing</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to go about tracking your competitors&rsquo; email marketing. You can, and should, head to their sites and sign up for their emails. Next, create a folder or label in your inbox where you can route all their messages. I recommend having the messages skip your inbox so you aren&rsquo;t bombarded by them all day long. It&rsquo;s just a place where you can go to see what they are up to when you have a few minutes to spare. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-swipe-file/">swipe file</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, we found a better way to do this using a service called <a href="http://emailinsights.com/" target="_blank">Email Insights</a>. Once you create an account, you simply add your competitors to a watch list and Email Insights does the rest. It pulls data about email frequency, subject line length and the time of day emails are sent.</p>

<p>The app doesn&rsquo;t have every newsletter in its database but you can request that they add your competitors for you. Give the 30-day free trial a spin, we think you&rsquo;ll really dig this service.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Content has been a <a href="http://whiteboard.getvero.com/inside-the-vero-blog" target="_blank">super successful strategy for us to grow</a> and I assume the same is true for other email service providers. As a blogger, I&rsquo;m really interested in what our competitors are doing with their content marketing. This process is harder to automate since it requires actually reading their content to get an idea of how good it actually us.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do is setup a <a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a> account. Next, create a collection called &ldquo;Competitors&rdquo; and start subscribing to your competitors&rsquo; RSS feeds. Here is what ours looks like:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty broad since huge companies like MailChimp aren&rsquo;t direct competitors but it gives me an idea of what they are talking about and how their customers are responding. I can even see how many RSS subscribers each blog has:</p>

<p>Just reading the posts is a good first step but there is more you can do to learn about their content. There are two Chrome extensions I use to get some insight on traffic and SEO.</p>
<p>First, I use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagerank-status/hbdkkfheckcdppiaiabobmennhijkknn?hl=en" target="_blank">PageRank Status</a> to get data on traffic. Just click PageRank Status button your Chrome toolbar and you can get a good idea of just how big a competitors&rsquo; audience is. Here&rsquo;s a look at MailChimp:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3731" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/track-your-competition/mailchimp-traffic-stats/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?fit=784%2C329&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="784,329" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mailchimp-traffic-stats" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?fit=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?fit=784%2C329&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3731" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png" alt="mailchimp-traffic-stats" width="784" height="329" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?w=784&amp;ssl=1 784w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?resize=300%2C126&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?resize=238%2C100&amp;ssl=1 238w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?resize=50%2C21&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mailchimp-traffic-stats.png?resize=75%2C31&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></p>
<p>150,000 visits per month is pretty impressive. (We obviously have some work to do.) I also want to know more about where their traffic is coming from and I use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mozbar/eakacpaijcpapndcfffdgphdiccmpknp?hl=en" target="_blank">MozBar Chrome extension</a> to get this data. Now I can see exactly who is linking to their blog. These are people that are obviously interested in email marketing and gives us ideas for people to reach out to for link building, guest posting and social sharing. (We&rsquo;ll talk more about this in the organic search section.)</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>There are so many ways to do this that it can actually be hazardous to your productivity. We recommend choosing a tool or two and spending no more than 30 minutes each week on this. The first thing you should do is follow all of your competitors&rsquo; Facebook pages, Twitter accounts and Google+ pages. Next, start creating lists on each social network. Google+ circles and Twitter lists are great for this. It will keep you in the loop but you get any meaningful data doing this. Here are few suggestions for getting real insight, along with a list of tools to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor what people think about your competitors</strong></p>
<p>Now, <em>this</em> is interesting. Using a tool like <a href="https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck" target="_blank">Tweetdeck</a>, you can filter out all the @mentions of any Twitter user. Here&rsquo;s what it would look like for MailChimp.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="366px"><img data-attachment-id="3736" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/track-your-competition/track-twitter-mentions/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?fit=366%2C632&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="366,632" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="track-twitter-mentions" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?fit=174%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?fit=366%2C632&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3736" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png" alt="track-twitter-mentions" width="366" height="632" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?w=366&amp;ssl=1 366w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?resize=174%2C300&amp;ssl=1 174w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?resize=58%2C100&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?resize=29%2C50&amp;ssl=1 29w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/track-twitter-mentions.png?resize=43%2C75&amp;ssl=1 43w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px"></p>
<p>Now you can see how people are reacting to their tweets, which is <em>much</em> more useful that seeing what they tweet out. You can setup columns for all your competitors in Tweetdeck and if they have separate accounts for customer support, be sure to follow those too (it&rsquo;s great way to learn what people like and dislike about their service).</p>
<p><strong>Monitor your competitors&rsquo; social influence</strong></p>
<p>Wildfire is our favorite tool for tracking follower growth on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. It&rsquo;s free to use and offers historical data on each of the three platforms. You can even measure the different platforms against each other.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified an article that&rsquo;s done well, you can see who shared it on Twitter by searching the URL on Twitter. This is a good opportunity to see who&rsquo;s interested in your competitors&rsquo; content and follow them on Twitter.</p>

<p>One thing to remember about the Internet is that it&rsquo;s <em>really big</em>. You might not even know who all of your competitors are. That&rsquo;s where our new favorite tool <a href="http://app.buzzsumo.com/" target="_blank">Buzzsumo</a> comes in. You can search for your target keywords and see what content is popular on social media.</p>

<p>You can save your searches to see how they change over time. Perhaps even more exciting is you can discover who the most popular influences are for different topics and keywords.</p>

<p>Moz pro users can get a ton of good competitor data regarding keyword rankings and link profiles. It&rsquo;s incredibly useful but it&rsquo;s not the only way to track how your competitors are ranking in search.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at how we use Google Alerts to keep track of email marketing content around the web as well as our own content. As you can see, we only have a few alerts setup and we really should be taking advantage of this powerful tool more.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="564px"><img data-attachment-id="3747" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/track-your-competition/google-alerts/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?fit=564%2C518&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="564,518" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="google-alerts" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?fit=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?fit=564%2C518&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3747" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png" alt="google-alerts" width="564" height="518" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?w=564&amp;ssl=1 564w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?resize=300%2C276&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?resize=109%2C100&amp;ssl=1 109w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?resize=50%2C46&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/google-alerts.png?resize=75%2C69&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px"></p>
<p>You can set the frequency of your alerts. Ours are different depending on the search. For example, I want to know as soon as our blog posts are indexed so I have those alerts delivered right away.</p>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>
<p><span id="more-3554"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>

<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed.

<ol><li>First I&rsquo;ll give you the only rationale you&rsquo;ll ever need to explain why landing pages are to marketers, what Immodium is to an astronaut with diarrhea. Essential.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll prove why context &ndash; not content &ndash; is king when it comes to conversion.</li>
<li>Following that, I will make you fall in love with forms. FYI, it&rsquo;s really, really hard to make form love a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Mid way through we&rsquo;ll sip some Canadian Club, get our Don Draper on, and learn how to write copy like the Mad Men (and Women).</li>
<li>&ldquo;Paint me a pretty picture Johnny!&rdquo; &ldquo;Screw you mommy. Design is not just rainbows and unicorns!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Is it greedy to want a second helping when you&rsquo;re an orphan? Not if you have my name. (It&rsquo;s Oliver in case you&rsquo;re confused).</li>
<li>Always ask for more when it comes to conversion .And finally, I&rsquo;ll put my art critic hat on and rip into some landing page examples, both good and bad.</li>

<p>This post is a beast at 2,300 words but it&rsquo;s loaded with ideas to make your emails smarter and more effective. Have you ever, for example, who your email is <em>really</em> from?</p>
<blockquote><p>Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email really from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized.</p></blockquote>

<p>Longform content has to be really, really good in order to keep our attention, and The Daily Egg does it right. This 1,500-word post, which is the fifth in a five part series, covers testing landing pages from top to bottom.</p>
<blockquote><p>To optimize anything, you need to conduct a scientific experiment, carefully analyze the results, select the optimal result, and repeat. If everything is done correctly, the results get better and better over time.</p>
<p>This concept applies very nicely to website design.</p>
<p>A good website design is one that delivers consistently high conversion rates. But even the best websites can increase conversions. You simply need to know how.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends. In addition to social media, email is one of the main reasons that home pages receive less traffic than ever. Rather than going looking for news and content, people get it delivered to them. Just one more reason to spend extra time developing <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-increase-revenue-34-percent/" target="_blank">strategic email newsletters</a>.</p>

<p>This post is more than a year old but after hearing Joanna speak at the Authority conference, I felt it was important to share. She breaks down which words are great for conversion and which words should be avoided at all costs. It&rsquo;s a great read.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friction words are words that describe things people <em>have</em> to do &ndash; not things people <em>want</em> to do. They cause cognitive friction. Web copy that converts is focused on what people <em>want</em> to do.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>32. <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64822-can-win-back-email-campaigns-help-reactivate-lapsed-customers">Can win-back email campaigns help reactivate lapsed customers?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Just so I&rsquo;m clear, when I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Email Onboarding&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not talking about newsletters or batch &amp; blast messaging that asks me to read your latest blog post.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is creating a narrative in the inbox that &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; seamlessly transitions me from &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; by acknowledging how I interact with the stuff you send me and adjusting itself accordingly, made possible by trigger &amp; behavioral based email rules.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>36. <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/your-next-email-subject-line/" target="_blank">4 Hacks You Should Know Before You Craft Your Next Email Subject Line</a></strong></p>
<p>We love hacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that we really liked Zach Bulygo&rsquo;s post on subject line hacks on the KISSmetrics blog. These tips are straightforward, simple and potentially very powerful. Keep this bookmarked for the next time you are struggling with a subject line.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no such thing as the perfect subject line. As a marketer, you need to test your subject lines and see which ones get the most opens. (Now, clearly, getting people to open your email is only one part. After that you need to get them to click or tap on something in the email.) But you&rsquo;ve won half the battle if you can get them to open the email.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>37. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html" target="_blank">What is spam?</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Godin, the father of permission marketing, offers a philosophical explanation of spam. In short, spam destroys trust. Read on to see how to earn trust and keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had never heard of the Weigel distribution but it&rsquo;s application to content marketing is spot on. Basically, the longer a visitor stays on your site, the less likely they are to leave. The principle is simple but getting those visitors interested in the first place isn&rsquo;t easy. Nate Munger breaks it down with plenty of examples and tips.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/how-long-stay.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>
<p>If you can keep them for 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re almost as likely to keep them for 2 minutes or more.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/retention-email-inspiration">Retention emails</a> are the lowest-hanging fruit of the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to increase your lead velocity rate and optimize your conversion to bring on new customers. Inactive users have already gone through that process and you&rsquo;ve already invested time and money in them. They see value in your product and, at some point, were ready to become a customer.</p>
<p><strong>Turning inactive users into active users is one of the easiest ways to generate revenue.</strong></p>
<p>As our CEO Chris Hexton wrote on the <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/03/20/examples-retention-emails/">CrazyEgg blog</a>, <strong>retention equals revenue</strong> and email is the best way to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if you&rsquo;re acquiring the right sort of customers and activating them rapidly it&rsquo;s super important to continue to monitor customers that go inactive and to prompt them to come back and use your software or purchase again. <strong>To maximize retention, spend a lot of time ensuring your customers don&rsquo;t leave.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>We took a look at five retention emails to see what keeps users engaged and what makes them forget about you. Check them out here, along with our five tips for creating killer retention emails below.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason that fitness apps have become so popular. They do two things really well:</p>
<ol><li>Help people set goals, track progress and become healthier</li>
<li>Make us feel guilty when we don&rsquo;t exercise <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol><p>There is a lot of emotion tied to self-confidence and body image. When <a href="http://runkeeper.com/" target="_blank">RunKeeper</a> emails their users to reactivate them, they are asking for so much more than logging data in their app.</p>
<p>RunKeeper faces an interesting challenge. If their users don&rsquo;t go out running on a regular basis, they have no reason to use the app. In order to keep user engagement high, RunKeeper actually has to focus on motivating people to exercise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an enviable position in some ways. People <em>know</em> they should be exercising and they <em>know</em> that using RunKeeper can help them lose weight and run faster. Both parties agree that app usage is a good thing. Instead of begging users to login and use their app, RunKeeper simply reminds users that getting back into an exercise routine is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Rocks</strong></p>
<ul><li>The subject line &ldquo;We miss you!&rdquo; &ndash; strikes just the right tone. It makes me feel like I am part of a community. It also makes me feel a bit guilty for not contributing to the community recently. Whichever emotion it elicits for you, it gets the email opened.</li>
<li>There isn&rsquo;t much copy in this email &ndash; just 24 words before the button &ndash; but RunKeeper is able to get me excited about exercising again. And they make it seem <em>so easy</em>. Just look at the language they use:
<ul><li>&ldquo;Great fitness habits start with small routines&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see progress in no time!&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The call to action &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in&rdquo; &ndash; is perfect. The implication is clear: this is a tribe of motivated, healthy people and we want YOU to join us.</li>
<li>The inclusion of social media links is also a good idea, since RunKeeper can use these channels for daily motivation.</li>
</ul><h2>2. Mint.com</h2>

<p><a href="http://mint.com/" target="_blank">Mint</a>&lsquo;s challenge is similar to RunKeeper&rsquo;s in that users <em>know</em> the software can lead them down a path of prosperity. The key is keeping them on task. This email from Mint is just loaded with motivation, inspiration and information.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Rocks</strong></p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing all the buzz&rdquo; &ndash; This makes me feel left out again. The tribe mentality is powerful and Mint is wise to play on that. It&rsquo;s a strong way to start this email.</li>
<li>I like all the links in the top of the email. There are five links before the first line of copy. For users who don&rsquo;t need any convincing to log back into Mint, it&rsquo;s easy to head to the website and get started again.</li>
<li>Just in case you have any doubt that Mint is the right tool &ndash; some users could have been testing Mint&rsquo;s competitors &ndash; this email contains three testimonials and three endorsements. I like that they have included testimonials from regular people as well as reviews from well-respected publications.</li>
<li>And if users still aren&rsquo;t sure, there are lots of smaller steps they can take. Earning a new Twitter follower or app user is a step in the right direction, even if it doesn&rsquo;t immediately get the user logged in and using Mint again.</li>
</ul><h2>3. AppFog</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3447" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/retention-emails/appfog-retention-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?fit=809%2C1076&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="809,1076" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="appfog-retention-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?fit=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?fit=770%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3447" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png" alt="appfog-retention-email" width="809" height="1076" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?w=809&amp;ssl=1 809w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=770%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 770w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=75%2C100&amp;ssl=1 75w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/appfog-retention-email.png?resize=56%2C75&amp;ssl=1 56w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px"></p>
<p>The first two emails were examples we should all strive to emulate but not every retention email is so effective. <a href="https://www.appfog.com/" target="_blank">AppFog</a> missed an important opportunity with this message. This email is different, however, because the stakes are higher. If I don&rsquo;t login to my account, I lose it. Yet there isn&rsquo;t a single link to a login page in this email!</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Needs Work </strong></p>
<ul><li>Email marketers: You can&rsquo;t tell users the email is friendly when in fact it&rsquo;s not. This email is way too long and complicated. There are four different dates mentioned, multiple activation options and no clear call to action.</li>
<li>This email could really benefit from a button. If you want people to login, <strong>make it as easy as possible</strong>. There isn&rsquo;t even a link to login page, let alone a clear direction for the user to take.</li>
<li>This email is frustrating in many ways but the biggest mistake is that it never reminds the user of the <strong>value</strong> of the their AppFog account. I used AppFog to make a sandbox for learning HTML and CSS. It has been enormously useful for me but nowhere in this email am I reminded of how this product can help me.</li>
</ul><h2>4. ProjectFlow</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3449" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/retention-emails/projectflow-retention-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?fit=807%2C614&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="807,614" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="projectflow-retention-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?fit=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?fit=807%2C614&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3449" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png" alt="projectflow-retention-email" width="807" height="614" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?w=807&amp;ssl=1 807w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=131%2C100&amp;ssl=1 131w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/projectflow-retention-email.png?resize=75%2C57&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px"></p>
<p>Why send an email without a call to action, especially when user engagement is so crucial to your business? <a href="https://www.projectflowapp.com/" target="_blank">ProjectFlow</a> made similar mistakes to AppFog by sending a vague, forgettable email. If you want people to take action, make it dead simple.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Needs Work</strong></p>
<ul><li>As the email states, I haven&rsquo;t logged into ProjectFlow in <strong>six months</strong>. At this point, I&rsquo;ve completely forgotten what the product is and why I signed up in the first place. This email could really benefit from some some screenshots, a video demo and a testimonial. Without a reminder of the value of the product, I have no reason to consider using it.</li>
<li>There is no clear call to action in this message. I understand they want me to login but there is no link or button to help me do it. This is one hundreds of emails I received that day. Since it doesn&rsquo;t capture my attention and encourage me to take action, it&rsquo;s forgotten.</li>
<li>One thing that retention emails should always avoid is a backup plan. Don&rsquo;t tell people they must login then offer an alternative. Decide what action they should take and use the entire email to emphasize it. It feels like they are saying goodbye to me rather than welcoming me back:<br><blockquote><p>For users who don&rsquo;t log in again in the next 7 days, we&rsquo;ll be closing your account on August 12. You can always sign up again later if you&rsquo;d like to give ProjectFlow another try. Thanks for trying ProjectFlow the first time around!</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Links to social media channels, blogs and customer success stories aren&rsquo;t backup plans, they are small steps towards a bigger goal. If the user isn&rsquo;t ready or willing to login immediately, offer other ways for them to stay connected. Then, you can use those platforms to keep them moving in the right direction.</li>

<p>Let&rsquo;s end this article on a positive note. <a href="http://www.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Weebly</a> killed it with this one.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Email Rocks</strong></p>
<ul><li>Weebly takes the customer support approach to this email. Not understanding how to use an app is one of the primary reasons users don&rsquo;t login and use products, even if they like the software. Offering help is an easy and inviting way to get people engaged.</li>
<li>Just like RunKeeper and Mint, Weebly makes me feel wanted by letting me know they miss me. Using words like &ldquo;we&rdquo; reminds users they aren&rsquo;t alone. There is a community of people like them who wish they would come and participate.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Auto Login&rdquo; button and link are awesome. Thank you, Weebly, for making it easy to take action.</li>
<li>The links to the social sites and blog are subtle but useful. Any opportunity to get users to follow you on other platforms is a good idea.</li>
</ul><h2>5 Tips for Killer Retention Emails</h2>
<ol><li><strong>Choose one call to action</strong> and use the entire email to emphasize it.</li>
<li><strong>Use buttons and deep links.</strong> Telling people to login without giving them an avenue to actually do it is a waste of time.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it concise.</strong> Use the copy to imply value, not convince people to take action. Don&rsquo;t waste space and attention with words that don&rsquo;t directly relate to your call to action.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid backup plans.</strong> Don&rsquo;t tell you users &ldquo;You must login or lose your account,&rdquo; then say &ldquo;But you could always make a new account later.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s confusing and will only distract users who might otherwise login.</li>
<li><strong>Create a sense of urgency.</strong> Giving users a timeframe to act can be a very powerful way to re-activate them. Don&rsquo;t frame it as an ultimatum though, just use time as a tool to keep them moving.</li>

From receipts, to order confirmations, and notifications, to reminders &mdash; transactional emails are often a welcome site even in the most crowded inboxes. <strong>They are nearly always functional, and almost always wasted opportunities. </strong> A study from Experian (<a href="http://www.experian.com/assets/marketing-services/reports/transactional-email-report.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>) found that open and click rates for transactional emails are significantly higher than promotional emails: <img data-attachment-id="2527" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/open-rates-transactional-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?fit=627%2C473&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="627,473" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Open rates for transactional emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?fit=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?fit=627%2C473&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-2527 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png" alt="Open rates for transactional emails" width="627" height="473" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?w=627&amp;ssl=1 627w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?resize=300%2C226&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/open-rates-transactional-emails.png?resize=75%2C57&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px"></p>
<p>People want these emails. They open them, click links and save them for later, yet very few marketers take the time to make them look good, let alone actually attempt to convert prospects or up-sell customers. <strong>Talk about a growth hacking opportunity!</strong></p>
<p>I took a look at a few recent transactional emails in my inbox to analyze and grade them. While each had glaring flaws, some actually used personalized data to provide me with useful resources and potentially even up-sell me. <strong>This post should serve as a reminder that marketing opportunities are all around us, you just need to think outside the box.</strong></p>

<h2>Geico Billing Notification</h2>
<p><em>Grade: C+</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2528" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/geico-transactional-email-640-1/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?fit=640%2C605&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,605" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="geico-transactional-email-640-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?fit=300%2C284&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?fit=640%2C605&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-2528 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png" alt="geico-transactional-email-640-1" width="640" height="605" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?resize=300%2C284&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?resize=106%2C100&amp;ssl=1 106w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?resize=50%2C47&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/geico-transactional-email-640-1.png?resize=75%2C71&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>Geico wins on customer service but they have room for improvement when it comes to email. This email is essentially reminding me how much money I have to pay them each month. It doesn&rsquo;t exactly make me feel warm and fuzzy. It&rsquo;s important, however, to remember that this email is a necessity &hellip; I&rsquo;d rather get the information than have them dance around the billing amount with a cute marketing ploy. So in one sense, Geico got this email right. In another, they left clicks and engagement on the table. Here are a few things they could have added to this email to make it more interesting:</p>
<ul><li>A mention of their mobile app</li>
<li>Social media icons and links</li>
<li>A link to their <a href="http://blog.geico.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> where they interview employees (Putting a face on a corporation goes a long way towards building trust.)</li>
<li>Information about <em>Geico Now</em>, their online magazine</li>
</ul><p>These are minor add-ons that could have major impact if rolled out to their <strong>more than 12 million policy-holders</strong>.</p>
<h2>Comcast Payment Receipt</h2>
<p><em>Grade: C</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/comcast-transactional-email-640.png" alt="Comcast transactional email example" width="640" height="392"></p>
<p>Comcast is the worst company in America &ndash; at least according to <em><a href="http://consumerist.com/2014/04/08/congratulations-to-comcast-your-2014-worst-company-in-america/" target="_blank">Consumerist</a></em> &ndash; but this email isn&rsquo;t so bad. Just like Geico, they keep it pretty simple. And they should, considering it&rsquo;s a reminder that I just coughed up another expensive cable bill. I appreciate that there is an easy way to contact customer service on the right sidebar (although who knows if it would <em>actually</em> be helpful) but they fall short on personalization.</p>
<p>The email addresses me as &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; and is signed &ldquo;Comcast&rdquo;. Why not up the customer service ante by personalizing this email with my name, and signing it &ldquo;Ron, Customer Happiness Manager&rdquo;? They have the data to do this. They also have the data to remind me that I have two episodes of <em>The Walking Dead</em> saved on my DVR. Why not remind me of that? Would it take a bit of work to make these emails more functional and interesting? Yes. Would it make me appreciate the good things Comcast offers? Absolutely.</p>
<h2>Southwest Flight Reminder</h2>
<p><em>Grade: A+</em> <img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/southwest-transactional-email-example.png" alt="Southwest Airlines transactional email example" width="725" height="2000"> Remember the Active.com email receipt from our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/">receipt growth hacking post</a>? This Southwest email reminds me a lot of that one. It could easily be considered overkill, but unlike a lot of these automated emails, it gets the job done. Take a look at what&rsquo;s going on in this email:</p>
<ul><li>They go for the up-sell right off the bat. Early Bird Check-in isn&rsquo;t something I need for this trip, but I&rsquo;m sure many people find it useful. For Southwest, it&rsquo;s an easy extra $12.50 per customer.</li>
<li>This email is highly personalized. Although the personal information is blurred out, it includes my name, all my flight information, confirmation number and information about the city I&rsquo;m traveling to.</li>
<li>Southwest is working with partners to make an extra buck. By advertising Budget&rsquo;s rental cars, they have an opportunity to make an affiliate fee.</li>
<li>I especially like the sections &ldquo;Useful Tools&rdquo;, &ldquo;Know Before You Go&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Specific Travel Needs&rdquo;. This information is really useful, especially for people who don&rsquo;t travel often.</li>
</ul><p>Well done, Southwest!</p>
<h2>OneReceipt Monthly Update</h2>
<p><em>Grade: A</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/one-receipt-email-example-640.png" alt="OneReceipt monthly email" width="640" height="743"></p>
<p>OneReceipt is a very cool service that helps you keep track of receipts. It automatically collects email receipts and allows users to upload photos of paper receipts too. Once per month, I get an automated email update on my spending. Just like Mint.com, OneReceipt keeps tabs on how much you spend each month to help you save money. (As you can see, I did a poor job of that in March.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I really like about this email &mdash; it&rsquo;s highly personalized. OneReceipt&rsquo;s business is based on helping their users visualize and understand their financial data. Since they know a lot about me, it makes sense to include some of this information in their automated emails. They tell me what I spent in the month, where I spent it, and how it compared to the previous month. It&rsquo;s branded, easy to read, and points me to important places like my OneReceipt dashboard, their social media sites, and even links to specific receipts.</p>
<h2>Recreation.gov Reservation Confirmation</h2>
<p><em>Grade: B-</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/recreation-gov-email-640.png" alt="Recreation.gov order confirmation email" width="640" height="2379"></p>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking &mdash; this email is hideous. Yes, it&rsquo;s ugly, but this email is actually loaded with useful information. It&rsquo;s the type of thing you might expect from a government-run organization. (Recreation.gov is how we reserve campsites at national parks in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Almost no one gives a second thought to aesthetics when it comes to transactional emails but they should, and here&rsquo;s why. The information in the email details directions to the campsites (they often hard to find) and campground rules (which help keep the outdoors safe and enjoyable). Unfortunately, it looks and reads like fine print. <strong>This means no one is ever going to read it.</strong> Here are a few ideas to make this email shine:</p>
<ul><li>Include pictures of the Grand Canyon. For crying out loud, it&rsquo;s one of the seven natural wonders of the world and there are tons of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/photosmultimedia/photogallery.htm">amazing photos in the public domain</a>. No excuses here.</li>
<li>This email absolutely needs to be mobile responsive. Campers aren&rsquo;t bringing their laptops for a weekend in the great outdoors, but they are bringing their smartphones. Here&rsquo;s what this email looks like on my iPhone.</li>
</ul><p class=" small-image" style="302px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/recreation-gov-mobile-email-2.png" alt="Recreation.gov mobile email example" width="302" height="535"></p>
<ul><li>One last suggestion: Send me to the <a href="http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2013/08/interior-departments-beautiful-instagram-account">Interior Department social media accounts</a>. They are beautiful, and a simple way for people to see what the national parks have to offer.</li>
</ul><p>How do you think these emails could have been improved? Let us know in the comments.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We&rsquo;d like to introduce you to some friends of ours&acirc;&#128;&#148;Unhaggle.</span></p>
<p>Unhaggle helps car buyers get the <a href="http://www.unhaggle.com">best price on a new car </a>without the hassle of negotiating.</p>
<p>They do this by getting up to 10 dealers to compete through a reverse auction process that&rsquo;s guaranteed to get the lowest price. They also show car buyers the average price people have paid for any car in their neighbourhood and the car dealers&rsquo; cost for free.</p>
<p>The result is what Unhaggle describes as &acirc;&#128;&#156;<strong>the smartest way to buy a car</strong>&acirc;&#128;&#157; and they&rsquo;re not wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-1692"></span></p>
<p>Recently, Unhaggle implemented some remarketing emails as a way to <strong>bring customers back to their site</strong> and to get them to download a free dealer cost report.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The reason for this campaign is that <strong>customers who download the report</strong> are much <strong>more likely to become a paying customer</strong>. Thus, it&rsquo;s an important step for visitors to take.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To begin, the team at Unhaggle followed the advice in one of our articles titled &acirc;&#128;&#156;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://blog.getvero.com/how-flightfox-doubled-their-remarketing-email-conversions/">How Flightfox doubled their remarketing email conversions</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.&acirc;&#128;&#157; This post advocates a Q&amp;A style approach to writing remarketing emails, the aim being to address customers&rsquo; fears head on by providing the answers to the three most common questions you receive from your customers.</span></p>
<p>Using a Q&amp;A style letter for the first email, Unhaggle found that it worked reasonably well, but they weren&rsquo;t completely happy with the results. They decided to test some different approaches to see if something else would convert at a higher rate. Specifically, they decided to test the following:</p>
<ul><li>Using a series of images instead of just text.</li>
<li>Driving customers toward a page that let them choose their specific make of car so they would download a more relevant report.</li>
<li>Including links directly to specific, popular vehicles as a way to entice visitors to click and learn more.</li>
</ul><p>Below are samples of what the e-mails looked like before and after the changes were made.</p>

<p>As you can see, the second email takes an entirely different approach and is much more visual than the initial, text-heavy, Q&amp;A style email.</p>
<p>So &ndash; what were the results of this experiment?</p>
<p><strong>Click through rates went up by 378%!</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snapshot direct from Unhaggle&rsquo;s email provider. The changes they made in the second campaign helped Unhaggle achieve a <strong>massive 32.4% click through rate. </strong>This is one of the highest click-rates we&rsquo;ve seen recently:<br><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1705" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/increase-click-through-rates-email-378-percent-unhaggle/email_2_stats-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?fit=952%2C149&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="952,149" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="email_2_stats" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?fit=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?fit=952%2C149&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1705" alt="email_2_stats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg" width="952" height="149" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?resize=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?resize=50%2C8&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?resize=75%2C12&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What exactly made the difference?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">With tests like this, it&rsquo;s interesting to consider what made a difference and convinced <strong>more people to take action</strong>. Based on what we can see here, the key factors are:</span></p>
<ol><li><strong>Images and visuals stirred up emotions:</strong> each visitor&rsquo;s desire for a new car is part of a buying process that&rsquo;s largely emotionally driven.</li>
<li><strong>The Q&amp;A was too wordy:</strong> it wasn&rsquo;t punchy enough to hit visitors hard. After all, they had only briefly visited Unhaggle in the past.</li>
<li><strong>It mentioned price more clearly:</strong> by emphasizing the deals people would receive, there was better alignment with the goal of &acirc;&#128;&#156;saving money&acirc;&#128;&#157; versus getting a &acirc;&#128;&#156;dealer report&acirc;&#128;&#157;. People don&rsquo;t want the report: they want to save money.</li>
</ol><p>What&rsquo;s interesting about these results is that in past articles, we often talk about <strong>NOT</strong> using images, but this is a case where that advice is clearly wrong.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It&rsquo;s really important to remember that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">best practices</a> are just that, as referred to in </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://blog.getvero.com/3-supposed-best-practices-in-email-optimisation-debunked/">this article about best email optimisation practices debunked</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: every change you make needs to be tested to ensure it&rsquo;s the right thing to do for your audience and will improve your email conversions.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It&rsquo;s also important to consider that certain types of email communications make more sense for visual presentations. Amazon and Net-a-Porter are both compaines we&rsquo;ve featured a regularly that successfully use lots of images in their email campaigns. This is due to the fact that sometimes text isn&rsquo;t as captivating, especially when you&rsquo;re selling products to an emotional buyer.</span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayjeya">Vijay Jeyapalan</a>, Marketing Director at Unhaggle, had to say about the 378% increase in click rate.</p>
<p><em>There are two big take-aways I learned from optimizing this email marketing campaign.</em></p>
<ol><li><em>Create multiple links to your destination page throughout the email and not just in one or two CTAs. As different parts of the email may trigger someone&rsquo;s interest and you want it to be linked so you can drive them to convert.</em></li>
<li><em>Even though you may see email copy work for other&rsquo;s in your industry or even in general, it might not be the best for your email marketing campaign. It&rsquo;s always best to use them as case studies to draw key learnings or test it with a variety of email designs to see what truly engages your customers.</em></li>
</ol><p>So, what about you?</p>
<p>What did you take away from this case study? <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Leave a comment to let us know what you learned and what you plan to test in your future campaigns!</span></p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Creating content that gets shared is <strong>super</strong> hard.</p>
<p>If it was easy we&rsquo;d all have a million uniques a month, right?</p>
<p>Learning a few tips and tricks to help you ensure each and every piece of content you put out has an <strong>impact</strong> will make your blog and email marketing much more powerful.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>5 tips you follow every time you&rsquo;re creating content</strong> to ensure that it has every opportunity to take off.</p>
<p><span id="more-1554"></span></p>
<h2 id="1.-use-real,-hard-data">1. Use real, hard data</h2>
<p><a title="Visual Website Optimizer" href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer</a> have had amazing success with their blog, right from the word go.</p>
<p>Founder Paras Chopra has consistently shared success stories from customers that share <strong>real details</strong>. Take just these last few posts:</p>
<ul><li>Banner Displaying Top Deals Increases eCommerce Engagement by 105%</li>
<li>One simple tactic that will always increase engagement &ndash; in this case by 40%</li>
<li>Eliminating Customers&rsquo; Fears with a Trust Badge Increased Sales by 32%</li>
</ul><p>This level of openness is very rare and, when VWO launched, it was unique to share such candid <strong>and practical</strong> tips on A/B testing.</p>
<p>Another fine example of the power of using data is the individual A/B testing guides that VWO launched <em>inside</em> their dashboard last year:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png"><img data-attachment-id="1564" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/epic-content-marketing-how-to/vwo-inside/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?fit=1415%2C708&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1415,708" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vwo-inside" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?fit=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?fit=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1564" alt="vwo-inside" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png" width="1415" height="708" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?w=1415&amp;ssl=1 1415w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?resize=200%2C100&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?resize=50%2C25&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vwo-inside.png?resize=75%2C38&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p>
<p>Each of the A/B test ideas in this guide has a detailed explanation of what to do <strong>and</strong> the facts to back up why you should bother.</p>
<p>Sharing statistics and hard data is one of those things that stands out every single time.</p>
<p><a href="http://open.bufferapp.com">Buffer&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/">&acirc;&#128;&#152;Open&rsquo; blog</a>, where they share all of their internal metrics from their run rate to their staffs&rsquo; salaries to their blog statistics, has been a huge hit <strong>because</strong> it is so candid. It breaks the mould.</p>
<p>This openness is absolutely killer when it comes to creating content that is talked about and shared. In short, it&rsquo;s a shortcut to the &acirc;&#128;&#152;epic content&rsquo; you always hear about.</p>
<p>A final example comes from GrooveHQ, whose Founder Alex Turnbull has been blogging weekly about <a href="http://groovehq.com/blog">their journey to $100,000/month revenue</a>.</p>
<p>A true look inside a growing SaaS business, Alex puts it all on the line and, in doing so, has garnered over 5,000 subscribers in mere weeks, the following of a huge list of influencers and a huge amount of respect from his target market.<br>
[external_quote the_quote=&rdquo;Sharing your experience and the lessons you&rsquo;ve learned can be incredibly valuable&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/alex-t.png&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Alex from Groove&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://groovehq.com/blog/in-five-weeks&rdquo;]</p>
<p><strong>Take away:</strong> Share real data. Maybe it&rsquo;s success stories from your customers, maybe it&rsquo;s your own internal data. Whatever it is, customers love reading about numbers and they love the hard facts to back up your claims.</p>
<h2 id="2.-build-something-practical">2. Build something practical</h2>
<p>Neil Patel recently blogged over on QuickSprout that he believes <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/10/14/move-over-content-marketing-why-creating-tools-can-be-a-better-investment-than-creating-content/">&acirc;&#128;&#156;creating tools can be a better investment than creating content&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>They stand out. You&rsquo;ve probably seen Moz.com&rsquo;s great <a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/">Open Site Explorer</a> and HubSpot&rsquo;s <a href="http://marketing.grader.com/">Marketing Grader</a>.</p>
<p>Neil recently released his own tool, the <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com">SEO Analyzer</a>, giving visitors the power to rate the SEO of their own site and get a list of things that need adjusting. Needless to say the tool is <strong>genuinely practical</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png"><img data-attachment-id="1561" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/epic-content-marketing-how-to/seo-analyzer-quicksprout/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?fit=1433%2C766&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1433,766" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="seo-analyzer-quicksprout" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?fit=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?fit=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1561" alt="seo-analyzer-quicksprout" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png" width="1433" height="766" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?w=1433&amp;ssl=1 1433w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?resize=300%2C160&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?resize=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?resize=187%2C100&amp;ssl=1 187w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?resize=50%2C27&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/seo-analyzer-quicksprout.png?resize=75%2C40&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p>
<p>Upon it&rsquo;s release Neil revealed that the bounce rate on his blog dropped from 75% to 63% and the average visitor now stayed on the site for over 3 minutes with almost twice as many page views.</p>
<p>The tool also drew in new readers as it was share-worthy &ndash; the tool was something that readers could not only use but wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at ways to grow your audience <strong>and</strong> increase your conversions then building a free tool is certainly a form of &acirc;&#128;&#152;epic content&rsquo; that nails it.</p>
<p>Neil&rsquo;s top tips for getting this right:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Build for your audience!</strong> Don&rsquo;t focus on yourself: do research and ensure you&rsquo;re building something that people actually want.</li>
<li><strong>Wireframe first</strong>. Use wireframes to get feedback and iterate until you&rsquo;ve got something that your customers want.</li>
<li><strong>Release on the same domain</strong>. Having one domain is far better than two for SEO reasons. Release your new tool on your own domain and you won&rsquo;t have to work as hard to drive traffic.</li>
</ol><p>[external_quote the_quote=&rdquo;Whatever you end up creating, make sure it is easy to use&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/neilpatelsidebar.jpg&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Neil from QuickSprout&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://quicksprout.com&rdquo;]</p>
<p><strong>Take away:</strong> What could you take from your application or website and turn into a free tool that your audience will love? By sharing such a great resource you&rsquo;ll improve the engagement of your current readers and get exposure to new readers as well.</p>
<h2 id="3.-make-it-visual">3. Make it visual</h2>
<p>Creating <a href="http://fizzle.co/sparkline/50k-in-first-month">long, detailed, informative posts</a> is important to set your blog apart <em>but</em> it can, at times, look like a huge wall of text!</p>
<p>Whilst your die-hard readers might hang on every word, every time, adding <strong>visual appeal</strong> to your content is guaranteed to make it <strong>more shareable</strong>.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make your audience think: the quicker it is to stomach, the easier it is to sharing 140 characters ;).</p>
<p>Content extraordinaire <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com">Gregory Ciotti</a> recently shared how important it is to include graphs, images or other visual representations in content he puts together.</p>
<p>An example from Greg&rsquo;s own writing is the inclusion of an image that quickly and humourously explains <a href="https://www.helpscout.net/blog/customer-reactions/">why customers really buy from your business</a>:</p>

<p>Greg&rsquo;s favourite example of all time comes from OkCupid. The <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">OkCupid blog</a> should be every content marketers&rsquo; inspiration.</p>
<p>Each and every post featured hand crafted representations of OkCupid&rsquo;s vast hoards of data, like this:</p>

<p>OkCupid&rsquo;s blog posts were perfect for this sort of visualzation as they were dealing with a heap of data, but that doesn&rsquo;t exclude you from doing something similar.</p>
<p>Putting some effort into your visuals can work for any content marketer.</p>

<p>Same content, different headline. 17x more effective! And we&rsquo;re talking 17 million views here.</p>
<p>17 million!</p>
<p>When it comes to writing epic content <strong>the headline matters</strong>. There is no point writing something that absolutely no one is going to read, right? Particularly when you&rsquo;ve spent 3 hours researching, 2 hours writing and and hour editing.</p>
<p>Zach Bulygo over at KISSmetrics shared his insights on <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/avoid-the-headline-holdup/">writing a headline that works</a>. There&rsquo;s a <em>ton</em> of meaningful information in his post, but here are two points that make a huge difference:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Lack of curiosity killed your page views:</strong> The thing that all great headlines seem to have in common is curiosity. A headline might be a question, it might be a list, it might just be a statement, but a great headline provides enough information to raise curiosity <em>in your target audience&rsquo;s mind</em> (i.e. it&rsquo;s not totally vague) but not enough detail <em>for them to know the answer</em> without reading the content.</li>
<li><strong>Know what makes your readers tick:</strong> Understanding what your audience cares about is the most obvious thing in the world but too many posts focus on the wrong things. To give you a head start, four topics that nearly always work are: money, controversial facts or findings, speaking up about the elephant in the room and <em>the truth</em> (see the stuff on Alex at Groove in part one).</li>
</ol><p>The ultimate tip here is to test things. Buffer shared how you can <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-writing-great-headlines-on-twitter-facebook-and-your-blog">scientifically write great headlines</a> using the power of Twitter.</p>

<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Andrew Chen (@andrewchen) <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewchen/statuses/195676548223868928">April 27, 2012</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Inspired by a post from Andrew Chen that describes the testing that led to his legendary post on <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/05/16/how-to-use-twitter-to-predict-popular-blog-posts-you-should-write/">growth hacking</a> there is a trick or two we can learn here.</p>
<p><strong>Take away:</strong> Don&rsquo;t slap a headline on your post just before you publish and don&rsquo;t go with the headline you had as a draft. Take 20 minutes to write out 25 headlines, A/B test them with whatever audience you have available and profit.</p>
<h2 id="5.-train-yourself-like-a-warrior">5. Train yourself like a warrior</h2>
<p>CopyBlogger&rsquo;s Demian Farnworth highlights <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/create-epic-content/">the power that epic content</a> can have as a marketing tool: the power to make your brand stand out and shine unique over your competition.</p>
<p>His advice is to consistently train yourself to get better at writing and writing well. His primary advice is to start by focusing on two things:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Your actual competition:</strong> don&rsquo;t worry about competing with the companies you <em>want</em> to compete with: focus on your competitors as your <strong>customers</strong> define them.</li>
<li><strong>Learn their strategy and stand unique:</strong> see what your competition is doing and learn from it. How does your content stack up against theirs? How are they achieving their goals?</li>
</ol><p>Demian then outlines a practical process to actually focus and get better at writing good content.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Read like mad</strong> &ndash; You should read everything you can on your niche and the topic areas you cover. Epic posts come when ideas accumulate to form a coherent, unique viewpoint. The only way to get this is to <strong>absorb</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Take notes</strong> &ndash; Take notes! Always take notes for future posts in a book or in digital form. Collect facts and reference points and come back to these at a later date.</li>
<li><strong>Be the dumbest guy in the room</strong> &ndash; Surround yourself with people that are smarter than you and <em>listen</em> to them. Great ideas come from smart people.</li>
<li><strong>Study your niche</strong> &ndash; what are all your competitors doing? How can you beat them?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Take away:</strong> Learning how to write great quality content is hard. Practical advice is few and far between. Your own process will differ a little but Damien&rsquo;s advice is sound. Ready, study and let it all come together in your mind before putting pen to paper!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These 5 points will help you form a checklist to follow when creating content that gets read and drives the conversions you want.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t easy: all of the tips and tricks here take time. The trick is ultimately to do your research and plan ahead.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re creating an eBook, a new email campaign or a blog post you will be able to find some juice for growth with these hints.</p>

<html><body><p>Ensuring you are targeting a willing, hungry and profitable audience is, without a doubt, the most important step of any marketing campaign. Getting this right upfront will save you hours of wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>Robert Coorey, Director of Global Marketing at e-Web Marketing, used science to help him ensure there was an audience waiting for his new book <a href="http://feedastarvingcrowd.com/"><strong><em>Feed A Starving</em> <em>Crowd</em></strong></a> which shares 200 tips for finding hungry customers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Rob ensured he would sell hundreds of copies of his book before he wrote a single word.</p>
<p><span id="more-1317"></span></p>
<p>Let me share the story of how I found a starving crowd of buyers for my new book using Amazon.</p>
<p>I was recently reading up on self-publishing and I came across a book called <em><strong>APE: Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur &ndash; How to Publish a Book</strong></em> by Guy Kawasaki.</p>
<p>I know and love Guy&rsquo;s work but, before buying the book, I was enjoying checking out some of the reviews (<em>don&rsquo;t we all?</em>)</p>
<p>One of the reviews was very detailed and gave the book <strong>just three stars</strong>. The reviewer was critical that the book didn&rsquo;t provide much help for unknown, first-time authors.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hot tip:</strong> In my opinion, three-star ratings are the best you can use for market research. Anyone who gives a one-star or a five-star rating is heavily biased. Maybe they are a fan of Guy (and would give anything he did 5 stars) or perhaps they have read every book out there and nothing would impress them anymore (leaving 1 star). Three-stars seems to be the sweet spot where the reviewer has considered the book, enjoyed some parts of it but has <em>constructive</em> criticism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Going back to through this and other reviewers&rsquo; comments I had an <em>&ldquo;aha moment&rdquo;</em>: launching a book for unknown authors is a huge concern and pain point. For anyone wanting to write a book from scratch and self-publish it there is so much to learn and to get right: authors want to learn how to sell the first 100 copies of their books coming from nothing. These authors have got no marketing budget but they do have plenty of time. They&rsquo;re not scared to do menial tasks to get their books out there, they just want to see results.</p>
<p>Best of all, they&rsquo;re <em>passionate</em> about their books: each author thinks his or her book is the best thing anyone has ever written! Fair enough; it probably is. Selling information products to bootstrapping authors is definitely feeding a starving crowd.</p>
<p>I used the above thought process (what I&rsquo;m terming the <em>&ldquo;Amazon method&rdquo;</em>) to write my latest book, <em>&ldquo;<a href="http://feedastarvingcrowd.com/">Feed a Starving Crowd</a>.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>Market research using the world&rsquo;s biggest bookstore</h2>
<p>Firstly, I looked at the top 100 marketing books on Amazon, and went through all of the 3 star reviews to find out what the common complaints were about each of these books. Here&rsquo;s a few examples:</p>
<p><em>Nothing particularly new here &ndash; just a solid revision of a</em><em>ccepted success principles.</em></p>
<p><em>No specific information, all general advice, its already been said elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>It takes forever to get to the point, too much waffle.</em></p>
<p><em>Doesn&rsquo;t help you if youre just starting out &ndash; only good if you&rsquo;re already established.</em></p>
<p><em>Not a &ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo; marketing book.</em></p>
<p><em>No processes or steps to follow &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t show you the how.</em></p>
<p><em>Most info can be found online for free.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;this got me thinking: what if I wrote a book that specifically addressed the concerns from these three star reviewers?</p>
<p>When I began writing my <em>&ldquo;Feed A Starving Crowd&rdquo;</em> I made sure that the information I shared was <em>brand new </em>and that there were <em>specific</em> instructions and exact steps, no boring general advice. I made sure the book was concise and too the point, <em>without any waffle </em>and that the strategies I recommended were either free or very inexpensive to implement. Finally, I made sure that all of the tips could be used by one-man bands, small businesses and entrepreneurs &hellip; I wanted to make it clear that you didn&rsquo;t need to be a massive big Fortune 500 company to use these tips.</p>
<h2>Walking the walk</h2>
<p>To show you what I mean, here is one of the tips from the book.</p>
<p>In 2012, Professor Kathleen Milkman of Wharton University published a study in the Journal of Marketing where she and her colleagues studied over 7,000 New York Times posts and looked to see which ones were the &lsquo;most viral&rsquo;. They found that there was very strong correlation between content that was highly emotionally charged and the content that got shared the most. This is a concept known as <em>&ldquo;the integral effect&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>In Professor Milkman&rsquo;s study,she also found that positive photos and content are much more likely to go viral than negative content. This quality is called <em>&ldquo;valence&rdquo;</em>. Researchers in this study found that content that was positive or had positive valence <strong>and</strong> was charged, emotionally-loaded content, was extremely likely to go viral. This is why Memes and inspirational quotes always do well on Facebook.</p>
<p>Rather than leave it there, I went further in the book and included a real-world example from a campaign I ran.</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, we used Professor Milkman&rsquo;s research to crack the code with our Punnky Facebook page. In the space of just a few days we managed to get over 100,000 likes and 22,000 shares.</p>

<p>How did the Punky campaign go so viral? There are a few reasons:</p>
<ol><li>We applied our online marketing skills and conversion rate optimisation techniques to this page (even though it&rsquo;s for a non-profit). For example we tested fifteen different styles of content (e.g. regular text post, image, video etc.) and also different content themes (love, funny, relationships). Here&rsquo;s were results of our analysis:</li>

<ol><li>We found was that images with a short caption worked the best. We also tested what the description should be to get the best results and found that a one-line description, followed by <em>&ldquo;Share if you &lt;agree/love this/ etc.&gt;&rdquo;</em> and then <em>&ldquo;Like Punnky for more great stories&rdquo;</em> worked the best. I&rsquo;m not saying this is the perfect formula for your fan page, but it worked well for us and the process should allow you to achieve similar results.

<p>The image in this specific example (the snapshot above) is very different. It is a screenshot of the <em>Notes</em> app from an iPhone and appears to be a personal message. This naturally creates curiosity &ndash; <em>&ldquo;I wonder what this personal message is?&rdquo;</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Our posts satisfied the results of scientific study which revealed how to make a post go viral using the integral effect.</p>

</ol><h2><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The results and what you should do next</span></h2>
<p>By taking a scientific approach to finding content for my latest book I was able to use Amazon&rsquo;s freely available review-library to put together a book that I knew was answering the cries for help from one of those who needed it most: the 3-star raters!</p>
<p>As a result of this approach and actually putting together content that answered customers&rsquo; feedback (sharing 200 tips like the one above) the early reviews for my book have been wonderful. So far we&rsquo;ve only received positive reviews (none of the mediocre stuff we were trying to avoid!) such as this great feedback from World-Renowned Motivational Speaker and Author, Brian Tracy:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This powerful, practical book is loaded with great ideas to help you sell more, faster and easier in any market.&rdquo;<br></em></p>
<p>How can you use publicly available information to find out what your audience likes and dislikes and distill this into your next blog post, webinar or eBook? It&rsquo;s this market research that will let you truly ensure you be feeding a starving crowd when you release your next marketing campaign!</p></body></html>
