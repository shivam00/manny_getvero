				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Blogging and content marketing has been one of the hottest trends over the past few years.</p>
<p>Online businesses figured out that by<strong> producing amazing content</strong> that provides value to their customer base they can increase traffic, educate and built trust: <strong>generating more leads and sales</strong>.</p>
<p>In this way, content ends up being a win-win for everyone: businesses get more people to their website and prospective customers get highly valuable information that helps them be more efficient and do their job better.</p>
<p>So, naturally, lots of businesses have bought into this strategy as a cost effective way to generate traffic, leads, and sales.</p>
<p>But not everyone has bought in: many businesses wonder if it&rsquo;s too much work and others aren&rsquo;t sure whether or not it really works.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re game to say that<strong> it does work</strong> and that we&rsquo;ve gotten amazing results thanks our content marketing here at Vero.</p>
<p>In order to back that up, we&rsquo;ll walk through <strong>three compelling reasons every business should consider starting a blog</strong> and discuss whether a blog is right for your business, or not.</p>
<p><span id="more-1772"></span></p>
<h2>Reason #1: Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
<p>In order to rank better in search engines you need more content. You need more pages on your site that can rank in Google and the handful of other search engines that will drive meaningful volumes of visitors to your site.</p>
<p><em>Fortunately</em>, one of the easiest way to get more quality pages is to publish content as blog posts.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: if you were to try add new pages to your site marketing site you&rsquo;d need to dream up and design fully-fledged, varying pages in order to do well. That ends up being a lot of work. It takes a lot of time and <strong>isn&rsquo;t replicable</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand writing a new blog post is a process that can be streamlined without losing meaning. Sure, your posts won&rsquo;t write themselves, but you can setup all the moving parts so that you just need to focus on finding a topic, writing thoroughly for a few hours and grabbing a couple of relevant screenshots. Once you&rsquo;ve got this nailed then, voila, you can <strong>relatively quickly generate new pages with a solid 1,000 to 2,000 words that can now rank in Google</strong> for a certain set of keywords.</p>
<p>Not only will blogging help you generate more pages with more content on your site, but you&rsquo;ll naturally have more opportunities to build inbound links &ndash; another big part of search engine optimization.</p>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t want to just take our word for it, <a href="https://twitter.com/neilpatel">Neil Patel</a> recently published an infographic on his blog <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">QuickSprout</a> that showed that businesses that blog receive 97% more inbound links when compared with sites that only have static pages.</p>
<p>The infographic also shared that sites with a blog have 434% more indexed pages than sites without.</p>
<p><img alt="LinksPages" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LinksPages.jpg" width="791" height="456"></p>
<p><em>Source: &acirc;&#128;&#156;<a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/12/13/why-every-business-should-blog/">Why Every Business Should Blog</a>&acirc;&#128;&#157; from QuickSprout</em></p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your SEO been lately?</p>
<p>Have you been scratching your head about how to get more inbound links and how to create more content for your site?</p>
<p>The hard data doesn&rsquo;t lie: business blogging and search engine optimization are a match made in heaven.</p>
<h2>Reason #2: Thought Leadership</h2>
<p>Not only will blogging help you drive more traffic from search engines but it will also help to build your personal and business brands as a thought leader. Building a brand isn&rsquo;t just for the big guys. Jason Lemkin shares the power a <a href="http://saastr.com/2013/10/15/in-the-early-days-you-wont-have-enough-customers-but-the-mini-brand-will-come-to-the-rescue/">mini-brand</a> can have in the success or failure of an early stage company.</p>
<p>So, <strong>how does content marketing help you to build a brand</strong>?</p>
<p>Simple: as you write blog posts, you draw from and share your personal and business expertise in the subject matter related to your business. Since you spend more time than anyone else thinking about your problem and its solutions, being an expert in your industry is something that should come naturally. After all, you&rsquo;re reading, studying, and working in your industry every day!</p>
<p>Take <a href="http://moz.com/about/team/randfish">Rand Fishkin</a> as an example.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="514px"><img data-attachment-id="1776" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/why-your-business-should-write-a-blog/randtwitter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?fit=514%2C235&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="514,235" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="RandTwitter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?fit=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?fit=514%2C235&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" alt="RandTwitter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg" width="514" height="235" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?w=514&amp;ssl=1 514w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=219%2C100&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=50%2C23&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=75%2C34&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s co-founder of <a href="http://moz.com/">Moz</a> (formerly SEOMoz) and recently stepped down from his role as CEO to do even more marketing and brand ambassador work. So where does he fit into the content marketing equation?</p>
<p>Basically, Rand is one of the finest examples of thought leadership that there is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been creating content on search marketing search engine optimization since the early 2000&rsquo;s and has been blogging and speaking on behalf of Moz the entire time. Thanks to his amazing content production he is now a well respected (if not legendary) expert in the search marketing field. His bio lists that he&rsquo;s spoken at Google, Facebook, and Microsoft and give presentations for the United Nations, Stanford University, Public Media, NPR, YCombinator, and Hackers &amp; Founders, in addition to co-founding <a href="http://inbound.org/">Inbound.org</a> with Dharmesh Shah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a resume, but it hasn&rsquo;t just led to his individual success.</p>
<p>The fact that Rand is such a well-respected thought leader in his field means that <strong>people take Moz that much more seriously</strong>. If Rand Fishkin is involved, then Moz must know what they&rsquo;re doing when it comes to SEO. The personal thought leadership Rand has developed is passed along and share with his company and lends credibility to the entire organization.</p>
<p>Another example is Neil Patel, co-founder of Crazy Egg and KISSmetrics, two internet marketing analytics companies. He&rsquo;s an expert when it comes to internet marketing, which lends credibility to both of those businesses.</p>
<p>People think, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;If Neil is involved in Crazy Egg and KISSmetrics, then they must be good at what they do because Neil really know his stuff.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p>Without blogging and without speaking, neither of these two thought leaders would hold the position they do. The reason Rand and Neil and hundreds of other founders are considered experts is because they write posts about their industry, which means they share their expertise and prove to people how much they know about their field.</p>
<p><strong>The same holds true for your business.</strong> If you&rsquo;re a personal finance company like <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> and you have one of the top personal finance blogs in the industry, then use that platform show people that your company really knows what it&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>Writing blog posts and demonstrating your business&rsquo;s expertise in a certain field goes a huge distance towards positioning your company (and founders) as a thought leader and builds credibility for your brand.</p>
<p>And just in case you don&rsquo;t want to take our word for it (again), here are some more stats for you:</p>
<ol><li>61% of consumers have made a purchase based on a blog post.</li>
<li>60% of consumers feel positive about a corporate brand after reading their blog.</li>
<li>82% of consumers enjoy reading relevant content from company blogs.</li>
<li>70% of consumers learn about a company through their blog rather than ads.</li>
</ol><p>When you combine all of these facets, business blogging is a great way to<strong> create a positive experience for your customers</strong> and to begin to influence them with your business&rsquo; expertise in its field.</p>
<h2>Reason #3: Leads and Sales</h2>
<p>Last but most <strong>definitely not</strong> least, the main reason your business should consider starting a blog in order to generate more leads and more sales.</p>
<p>As you write new posts that get read by your subscribers, shared via social media, and found through search engines, you&rsquo;ll generate more and more traffic. Combined with the power of SEO (as per point one) this traffic will build, slowly at first and exponentially later, constantly increasing the number of potential customers that come across your product and give your homepage a look.</p>
<p>This can only help sales go in one direction: <em>up</em>.</p>
<p>The great thing about content is that not all customers are ready to buy on the first visit. As you&rsquo;ll be blogging regularly you have lots of opportunity to talk with your potential customers and share all sorts of great ideas. After visiting your site 10, 20, or 30 times over the course of six months to a year, the time will be right for these potential customers to buy and your product will well and truly be in the running.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://getvero.com">Vero</a>, our most important blog statistics are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>We generate <strong>65% of our traffic</strong> via our blog,
</li>
<li>
<p>42% of trial signups read a blog post <strong>before signing up to Vero</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over 65% of all paying Vero subscribers read at least one blog post before paying.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The majority of our other customers come via word of mouth, many of whom likely heard about us from blog readers. To be honest, if we didn&rsquo;t have a blog, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a clue how to grow our business in such a cost effective way or <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/startup-first-year-growth/">as quickly as we have</a>.</p>

<p>Managing a blog takes time and sometimes it takes money too (when we pay for writing or design work) but the dollar cost pales in comparison to the cost of running an AdWords campaign that would generate the same amount of traffic, leads, and sales for our site. Further more, no other channel would help us build thought leadership and long-lasting, lead-generating content like blogging does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say we&rsquo;re big fans of business blogging since we&rsquo;ve seen such good results with our own blog here at Vero.</p>
<h2>Should <em>Every</em> Business Really Have a Blog?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on the original premise of this post: that <em>every</em> business should have a blog.</p>
<p>Is that <em>really</em> true?</p>
<p>To be honest, saying it that way stretches the truth ever so slightly. There&rsquo;s a<strong> ton of benefit that comes from blogging</strong>, and yes, 99% of businesses can benefit from having a blog, but not every business should have one.</p>
<p>So how do you know if your business should or shouldn&rsquo;t? Here are some key indicators:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Do you or does someone else on your staff have the time to write multiple blog posts per month consistently?</strong> Consistency is key when it comes to business blogging. If you&rsquo;re not able to consistently produce high-quality content, then maybe you should consider whether or not a blog is right for your business. You should first evaluate the time commitment required and then make sure you&rsquo;re ready to commit to the work that successful business blogging takes. If you don&rsquo;t post consistently you&rsquo;ll just get bummed out and blame it on the content marketing. Consistency helps you stay focused, learn to improve your writing and look to the future. Just like any other marketing, contnet is about testing ideas, seeing what works and repeating.</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Are you willing to hire freelance writers to produce content for your blog if you don&rsquo;t have the time?</strong> If you&rsquo;re not able to invest the time required to consistently produce content for your blog, then you may want to consider hiring a freelance writer. In case you do, make sure you look for qualified writers who are experts in your field and know how to write top-notch blog content. It&rsquo;s worthwhile to pay a little more ($150 to $200 per post) to hire someone that really knows what they&rsquo;re doing. This is a much harder road to start with: there is nothing like becoming your own content master but it is a viable path if you can work with truly dedicated writers.</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Are you willing to invest the time it takes to become successful?</strong> Gaining traction with business blogging can easily take six months or more. Your site needs to build momentum, you have to develop relationships with other bloggers and you have to learn how to promote your posts. All of these points take time to learn and to pick up steam. If you&rsquo;re not willing to invest at least six months until you start seeing good results, then starting a blog might be something you want to put on hold until you&rsquo;re ready.</li>
</ol><p>Having said all that: if you put in the time and have the excitement to learn and improve your content marketing then business blogging is one of the most powerful ways you can drive traffic that converts to your website.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Should every business have a blog, or is business blogging, i.e. content marketing, a waste of time for a lot of businesses?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We&rsquo;d like to introduce you to some friends of ours&acirc;&#128;&#148;Unhaggle.</span></p>
<p>Unhaggle helps car buyers get the <a href="http://www.unhaggle.com">best price on a new car </a>without the hassle of negotiating.</p>
<p>They do this by getting up to 10 dealers to compete through a reverse auction process that&rsquo;s guaranteed to get the lowest price. They also show car buyers the average price people have paid for any car in their neighbourhood and the car dealers&rsquo; cost for free.</p>
<p>The result is what Unhaggle describes as &acirc;&#128;&#156;<strong>the smartest way to buy a car</strong>&acirc;&#128;&#157; and they&rsquo;re not wrong.</p>
<p><span id="more-1692"></span></p>
<p>Recently, Unhaggle implemented some remarketing emails as a way to <strong>bring customers back to their site</strong> and to get them to download a free dealer cost report.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The reason for this campaign is that <strong>customers who download the report</strong> are much <strong>more likely to become a paying customer</strong>. Thus, it&rsquo;s an important step for visitors to take.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To begin, the team at Unhaggle followed the advice in one of our articles titled &acirc;&#128;&#156;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://blog.getvero.com/how-flightfox-doubled-their-remarketing-email-conversions/">How Flightfox doubled their remarketing email conversions</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">.&acirc;&#128;&#157; This post advocates a Q&amp;A style approach to writing remarketing emails, the aim being to address customers&rsquo; fears head on by providing the answers to the three most common questions you receive from your customers.</span></p>
<p>Using a Q&amp;A style letter for the first email, Unhaggle found that it worked reasonably well, but they weren&rsquo;t completely happy with the results. They decided to test some different approaches to see if something else would convert at a higher rate. Specifically, they decided to test the following:</p>
<ul><li>Using a series of images instead of just text.</li>
<li>Driving customers toward a page that let them choose their specific make of car so they would download a more relevant report.</li>

<p>As you can see, the second email takes an entirely different approach and is much more visual than the initial, text-heavy, Q&amp;A style email.</p>
<p>So &ndash; what were the results of this experiment?</p>
<p><strong>Click through rates went up by 378%!</strong></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snapshot direct from Unhaggle&rsquo;s email provider. The changes they made in the second campaign helped Unhaggle achieve a <strong>massive 32.4% click through rate. </strong>This is one of the highest click-rates we&rsquo;ve seen recently:<br><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1705" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/increase-click-through-rates-email-378-percent-unhaggle/email_2_stats-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?fit=952%2C149&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="952,149" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="email_2_stats" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?fit=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?fit=952%2C149&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1705" alt="email_2_stats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg" width="952" height="149" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?resize=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?resize=50%2C8&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/email_2_stats.jpg?resize=75%2C12&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What exactly made the difference?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">With tests like this, it&rsquo;s interesting to consider what made a difference and convinced <strong>more people to take action</strong>. Based on what we can see here, the key factors are:</span></p>
<ol><li><strong>Images and visuals stirred up emotions:</strong> each visitor&rsquo;s desire for a new car is part of a buying process that&rsquo;s largely emotionally driven.</li>
<li><strong>The Q&amp;A was too wordy:</strong> it wasn&rsquo;t punchy enough to hit visitors hard. After all, they had only briefly visited Unhaggle in the past.</li>
<li><strong>It mentioned price more clearly:</strong> by emphasizing the deals people would receive, there was better alignment with the goal of &acirc;&#128;&#156;saving money&acirc;&#128;&#157; versus getting a &acirc;&#128;&#156;dealer report&acirc;&#128;&#157;. People don&rsquo;t want the report: they want to save money.</li>
</ol><p>What&rsquo;s interesting about these results is that in past articles, we often talk about <strong>NOT</strong> using images, but this is a case where that advice is clearly wrong.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It&rsquo;s really important to remember that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">best practices</a> are just that, as referred to in </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://blog.getvero.com/3-supposed-best-practices-in-email-optimisation-debunked/">this article about best email optimisation practices debunked</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: every change you make needs to be tested to ensure it&rsquo;s the right thing to do for your audience and will improve your email conversions.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It&rsquo;s also important to consider that certain types of email communications make more sense for visual presentations. Amazon and Net-a-Porter are both compaines we&rsquo;ve featured a regularly that successfully use lots of images in their email campaigns. This is due to the fact that sometimes text isn&rsquo;t as captivating, especially when you&rsquo;re selling products to an emotional buyer.</span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://twitter.com/vijayjeya">Vijay Jeyapalan</a>, Marketing Director at Unhaggle, had to say about the 378% increase in click rate.</p>
<p><em>There are two big take-aways I learned from optimizing this email marketing campaign.</em></p>
<ol><li><em>Create multiple links to your destination page throughout the email and not just in one or two CTAs. As different parts of the email may trigger someone&rsquo;s interest and you want it to be linked so you can drive them to convert.</em></li>
<li><em>Even though you may see email copy work for other&rsquo;s in your industry or even in general, it might not be the best for your email marketing campaign. It&rsquo;s always best to use them as case studies to draw key learnings or test it with a variety of email designs to see what truly engages your customers.</em></li>
</ol><p>So, what about you?</p>
<p>What did you take away from this case study? <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Leave a comment to let us know what you learned and what you plan to test in your future campaigns!</span></p></body></html>

<p>Emirates kicks off the list with this email, sent a few weeks before an international departure. By using their data they have singled out customers that are a) traveling a long distance, b) traveling economy, c) traveling soon and d) on an aircraft with and upgrade available. The copy to &lsquo;make us an offer&rsquo; likely gets a lot of click-throughs: it&rsquo;s different from the usual &lsquo;Pay $X to upgrade now&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t forget that using a future activity as the trigger point for an email is a great opportunity to upsell or re-engage customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://hackpad.com/">Hackpad</a> send out this awesome email when you create your fifth &lsquo;pad&rsquo;. In the Hackpad world this is a sign of activation: it&rsquo;s a sign you&rsquo;re fully engaged with the product.</p>
<p>Every SaaS company should be sending something like this. Not only does it congratulate the recipient but it encourages them to check out another popular feature. This not only gets them back to Hackpad&rsquo;s site but is genuinely helpful and encourages the customer to try something they may not have used yet. If they like it, there&rsquo;s every chance they&rsquo;ll be a customer sooner and for longer.</p>

<p>If you take a call on <a href="http://clarity.fm">Clarity.fm</a>, the savvy marketers there will be sure to follow up with this email campaign. When developing your lifecycle emails it&rsquo;s important to reflect on Dave McClure&rsquo;s infamous <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/06/internet-market.html">AARRR</a> metrics.</p>
<p>Clarity nails the <em>retention</em> &lsquo;R&rsquo; with this email. For anyone that has had a call via Clarity, you&rsquo;ll know that there is often a ton of follow-up questions and &lsquo;homework&rsquo; coming out of your calls. This email takes advantage of that fact and is a genuinely useful reminder to touch base with the mentors you&rsquo;ve spoken to.</p>

<p>A great data-driven email, YouTube used this email to target customers that had watched any of 2013&rsquo;s trending videos. The goal here is to get viewers that would be considered &lsquo;tastemakers&rsquo; or &lsquo;influencers&rsquo; to re-watch something they may have enjoyed early in the year and get them to share it again, perhaps even to &lsquo;brag&rsquo; that they&rsquo;d seen it first.</p>

<p>This is a simple email. It&rsquo;s not sexy, it doesn&rsquo;t even have a digital call to action&hellip;but there is something magical about the way the physical device on my wrist virtually sends me a reminder when it&rsquo;s battery is low.</p>
<p>This campaign is an example of <strong>surprise</strong>. How can you surprise and delight your customers with something as helpful as this email from FitBit?</p>

<p>Mouseflow helps you track your customers&rsquo; on-site mouse movements. They have to ensure their customers install Javascript on their website and they use this campaign to help get them over the line. This is more unique than other activation emails we&rsquo;ve seen recently as the call to action asks customers to &lsquo;claim their bonus&rsquo;. In a way, the bonus is artificial. It&rsquo;s designed to get customers installed faster and it&rsquo;s worth it to Mouseflow to reward the users that do install the Javascript with a little extra as, ultimately, there&rsquo;s a much higher chance they&rsquo;ll activate than if they don&rsquo;t get the Javascript installed at all.</p>

<p>If, at any point, you use LinkedIn&rsquo;s Address Book import feature then you&rsquo;ll notice a list of LinkedIn contacts that &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t yet on LinkedIn&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If any of these contacts every join, you&rsquo;ll get an email like the one above. The idea is to help seed the new user&rsquo;s profile with a flurry of new contacts straight away, as well to increase your own network. A win-win for you, the new use and LinkedIn, this is a quality campaign.</p>

<p>At Vero, we use Facebook&rsquo;s retargeting and ad features, though sparingly. This campaign from Facebook appears to have been targeted after I had not logged into our Facebook business account for a period.</p>
<p>All three calls to action lead to the exact same page: a guide for getting started with Facebook&rsquo;s ad targeting tools. The focus and aim of this campaign are perfect for B2B lifecycle email. Targeting customers that are active users but may have gone a little quiet or <strong>have not</strong> used a particular feature is the perfect way to build up engagement or make more money.</p>

<p>The following email from BigCommerce was sent just before Christmas. We&rsquo;ve got a few demo accounts for BigCommerce for testing. This campaign gets a mention, not because it&rsquo;s particularly data-driven in it&rsquo;s copy, but because of BigCommerce&rsquo;s approach to it&rsquo;s delivery.</p>
<p>Check out these from addresses:</p>

<p>It looks like BigCommerce assigns individual customer service representatives to each account. This is a great way to spread the load and create a truly personal experience. What a fantastic example.</p>

<p>CodeClimate is a very useful application for a company built on technology. Their notification emails are great for two reasons: 1. they&rsquo;re clear and direct, and 2. they don&rsquo;t make you go back to the website to get value from them. This particular example is twice as good, as the team at CodeClimate have dynamically inserted a notification that your trial is about to expire. This is how you should be doing trigger-based, transactional email.</p>

<p>Pocket&rsquo;s year-end email is reminiscent of LinkedIn&rsquo;s <a>top 5% of user&rsquo;s campaign</a> last year. The copy of the email gives it a personal touch despite the fact that Pocket has over 7.5 million users, making the top 1% a rather large 74,000. Using data to create a personal message is powerful and there is no doubt you could use your own data to create an email just like this.</p>

<p>Another example from Fitbit (crushing it here) is this 2013 summary email. Pulling data for each and every customer and combining it with some cheeky copy gives this campaign a unique feel. &ldquo;A turtle would take <em>364</em> days to skateboard that fast&rdquo; is a fantastic way to present data and a great example of fun copy.</p>
<p>How can you combine a positive, fun tone with customer data to create something different?</p>

<p>Paypal have been working extremely hard over the last year to improve their branding and online toolset. This email is an interesting one. It was triggered when the account had a positive balance that had not been touched for a while. The call to action is a little vague but this is an effective email to remind inactive customers that <strong>do</strong> have the ability to make purchases or send money that they shouldn&rsquo;t forget about their Paypal balance.</p>
<p>How can you target inactivity and segment out users that can take positive action <strong>immediately</strong>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><ul><li>Google have now started caching images for all emails opened via Gmail.</li>
<li>This means images are displayed by default, <strong>generally a good thing for email marketers</strong>.</li>
<li>This will have an impact on how <strong>opens</strong> are tracked and it&rsquo;s interesting and important to understand why.</li>
</ul><p>Throughout 2013 Google made a number of changes to Gmail, in particular their &acirc;&#128;&#152;tabbed inbox&rsquo; feature.</p>
<p>In early December last year, Google announced a new change to the way <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/images-now-showing.html">images are being handled by the Gmail client</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1374"></span></p>
<p>Images will now be displayed <strong>by default</strong> rather than asking recipients on a one-to-one basis whether they&rsquo;d like to load images.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Gmail put it themselves:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="500px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Images.gif"><img alt="Images" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Images.gif" width="500" height="430"></a></p>
<p>Rather than seeing &acirc;&#128;&#152;Display images&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll just get the images:</p>
<h2 id="how-this-impacts-you">How this impacts you</h2>
<p>Firstly, it&rsquo;s a positive change!</p>
<p>Email marketing software tracks opens using a small image (1px by 1px side) at the end of an email. The image is unique for every email sent.</p>
<p>When a customer opens your email this image is loaded which requires a call to a server. Using the unique &acirc;&#128;&#152;name&rsquo; of the image, the server knows who loaded the image, where they were and the time it occurred. In many other cases you can also glean useful meta-data such as the browser and email client the recipient is using.</p>
<p>Many email clients do load images by default but, for a long time, Gmail has had images <strong>disabled by default</strong>.</p>
<p>This has meant that open figures for recipients using Gmail have been underreported by email marketing tools, simply because there has been no reliable technical way to ensure recipients enabled their images.</p>
<p>As Gmail has announced they&rsquo;ll be displaying images <strong>by default</strong>. This means that open rates will, in fact, be <strong>more accurately reported</strong> for recipients using Gmail as Google will <strong>definitely</strong> load the tracking pixel at least once, rather than leaving the decision to the recipient.</p>
<h2 id="how-this-impacts-marketers-negatively">How this impacts marketers negatively</h2>
<p>The caveat to the above is that Google will be <strong>caching</strong> the image that is loaded.</p>
<p>What this means it that the image will be loaded via Google&rsquo;s web servers and a copy will be saved.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the process looks as a diagram:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/caching.png"><img alt="caching" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/caching.png" width="640" height="450"></a></p>
<p>Due to Google&rsquo;s caching the image will only ever be loaded from <strong>their servers</strong>. This potentially limits the meta-data that can be taken from the image request: the recipient&rsquo;s computer will appear as one of Google&rsquo;s servers. Rather than saying the email was opened in Dubrovnik, Croatia, it&rsquo;ll say it was opened in Mountain View, California (or some other Google data center).</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</h2>
<p>There is nothing specific you need to do other than be aware of these changes and how it impacts the way you interpret your data!</p>
<p>The change is already live for most Gmail customers. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this change appears to affect all Gmail clients, <em>including</em> the iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that customers using <em>other</em> email clients are <strong>completely unaffected</strong>.</p>
<p>The changes are, on the whole, a step in a good direction. There are a number of reasons Google is likely to have implemented these changes but they quote security as number one and this seems likely. Ensuring that emails to do not contain malware is an excellent outcome of the changes. Speed is likely also to improve.</p>
<p>As an email marketing it&rsquo;s also positive to see images loading by default (great for those with image-heavy templates or EDMs) and it is likely a small trade-off to lose some of the meta-data. We expect customers will see positive data from this change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>When it comes to marketing there are traditional approaches like pay-per-click advertising, newsletter advertising, billboards, directories, radio, webinars, and the new and popular approaches of inbound marketing, partnerships, and remarketing.</p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;yet, it&rsquo;s often the less traditional approaches that lead to the biggest growth. Andrew Chen shared his observations on one of <a>AirBnB&rsquo;s fantastic distribution hacks</a>:</p>
<p>[external_quote the_quote=&rdquo;Airbnb does just this, with a remarkable Craigslist integration. They&rsquo;ve picked a platform with 10s of millions of users where relatively few automated tools exist, and have created a great experience to share your Airbnb listing.&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/may2012.jpg&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Andrew Chen&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://andrewchen.co/2012/04/27/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/&rdquo;]</p>
<p>AirBnB let customers list on Craigslist, increasing the usefulness of their platform and opening up a whole new audience. This hack wasn&rsquo;t a simple plug-and-play solution. It required thinking <em>outside the box</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s these sorts of strategies that drive insane growth: these are the opportunities you should be looking out for. Here are 3 distribution strategies that you probably haven&rsquo;t thought of. 3 strategies that could provide you with inspiration for an exponential growth tool of your own.</p>
<p><span id="more-1233"></span></p>
<h2>1. Acquire a complementary service or product</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://pin.net.au/">Pin Payments</a> acquired <a href="https://spreedly.com/">Spreedly</a> earlier this year, they exemplified how using an acquisition strategically can instantly bring customers to a growing product <strong>and</strong> improve the overall offering of both products for current customers.</p>
<p>Pin Payments is an all-in-one payment gateway that lacked the ability to manage subscription payments. Spreedly was the opposite; they had a way to manage subscription payments, but required you to plug in a merchant account.</p>
<p>By purchasing Spreedly, Pin no doubt acquired many new customers <strong>and</strong> improving their product.</p>
<p>This strategy is nothing new, though it is regularly overlooked. There are many reasons to acquire other companies and one of the most common is to get access to a new customer base: a customer base you can cross-sell your main products to.</p>
<p>Take social-media sharing tool <a href="http://bufferapp.com">Buffer</a>. A few years ago Buffer <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/buffer-digg-digg">acquired a relatively small WordPress plugin</a> called &lsquo;Digg Digg&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The plugin allowed WordPress site owners to install a simple widget that added the Twitter, Facebook and other sharing buttons to each of their blog posts. It was easy to install and very practical. A great plugin.</p>
<p>Buffer purchasing a plugin to add the social media buttons for services like Facebook and Twitter might seem a little esoteric at first but it is probably the <strong>best example of an acquisition for the sake of distribution that you&rsquo;ll see</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see what the Digg Digg plugin does when implemented on a WordPress blog by looking to the left (we use Digg Digg).</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong> being acquired, the Digg Digg bar had been developed for ~2 years. It was was regularly updated and usable, but not flashy. After the acquisition, here&rsquo;s the first change the Buffer team pushed:</p>

<p>Why is this awesome? Everyone that installs Digg Digg could all of a sudden easily add a Buffer button to <strong>every post on their blog</strong> alongside Twitter and Facebook. Better yet, that button is enabled <em>by default.</em></p>

<p>Having just made an awesome acquisition, Buffer did the smart thing and went to town sharing how easy Digg Digg made it for their customers to add social sharing to their blogs.</p>
<p>Buffer encouraged current Buffer customers to install Digg Digg. Combined with the press coverage they received for the acquisition this meant that the Digg Digg bar,and the Buffer button, started cropping up everywhere. The net result is that every time <strong>anyone</strong> visits a blog post on <strong>any blog</strong> that runs Digg Digg, Buffer gets marketing exposure.</p>
<p>This created a savvy acquisition channel for Buffer. Here&rsquo;s what happens if you&rsquo;re <strong>not</strong> a Buffer user and you click a Buffer button:</p>

<p>This is a fantastic example of an extremely well-executed acquisition. This approach is relatively rare at the grass-roots level and much more common at the bigger end of town.</p>
<p>In 2011, eBay acquired <a href="http://magento.com">Magento</a>, an eCommerce platform.</p>
<p>eBay needs merchants. It needs quality merchants to ensure it has a great range of products available. eBay realised it could also make money selling new, quality goods through its platform to a huge audience of hundreds of millions of customers. How to get more merchants? Acquire Magento.</p>

<p>eBay wants you to list your Magento products on eBay and your eBay products on Magento. If you&rsquo;re a Magento user, here is how easy it is to list your items on eBay too:</p>

<p>Another great example of an acquisition that makes a lot of sense from a distribution standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Growth tip:</strong> To be really successful an acquisition should encourage customers of both the current and new products to adopt the entire ecosystem quickly.</p>
<p>By acquiring such a useful plugin in Digg Digg, Buffer encouraged current users to adopt the tool, increasing exposure immediately. Likewise, WordPress and Digg Digg users could find value in Buffer.</p>
<p>eBay purchased a platform that let its current customers start up their own store, let store owners sell products on eBay, and in doing so, created network effects that are hard to beat.</p>
<p>What complimentary products or services exist for your product, and how could you combine them with your own to multiply your distribution by a factor of 10?</p>

<p>Neil Patel recently launched the QuickSprout <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">SEO website analyzer</a>:</p>

<p>The analyzer is a free tool into which anyone can place their URL and get a host of <strong>practical</strong> tips to improve their SEO. From comparing your page speed to finding errors in your titles and meta data to comparing you to your competitors, Neil&rsquo;s free tool puts a lot of value in one place.</p>
<p>Neil himself <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/10/14/move-over-content-marketing-why-creating-tools-can-be-a-better-investment-than-creating-content/">talks of the $45,000 he&rsquo;s <em>already</em> spent</a> building the tool and the many more thousands he&rsquo;ll spend to improve it.</p>
<p>Neil&rsquo;s approach in releasing a free tool is to create something people will get value from, talk about, share and, in turn, drive new and relevant traffic to QuickSprout.</p>
<p>Building what is essentially a <strong>new product</strong> is risky but, if it fills a need and delivers value, it can be an extremely powerful way to drive large amounts of consistent traffic over the long term.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/10/14/move-over-content-marketing-why-creating-tools-can-be-a-better-investment-than-creating-content/">website analyzer</a> is already generating around 1,000 URL analyses <strong>per day</strong>. The ultimate aim of the tool is to generate leads for Neil&rsquo;s consulting businesses and, potentially, for a premium version of the tool.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an effective strategy and Neil was kind enough to share the reason he put so much effort into building a free tool:</p>
<p>[quote the_quote=&rdquo;Building a free tool to market your site can be extremely powerful. Companies like Moz.com and HubSpot have made great use of this tactic in the past. Quick Sprout&rsquo;s new analyzer is doing extremely well and it can easily be monetized to bring in thousands of new customers a month.&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/neilpatelsidebar.jpg&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Neil Patel&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://quicksprout.com&rdquo;]</p>
<p>The website analyzer is not the first example of a free tool playing an important role in customer acquisition.</p>
<p>Moz has embraced this approach effectively for a long time now. Check out their <em>range</em> of free tools:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png"><img data-attachment-id="1248" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/get-more-customers-growth-hacking/moz-com-free-tools/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?fit=1263%2C696&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1263,696" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="moz.com-free-tools" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?fit=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?fit=1024%2C564&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1248" alt="moz.com-free-tools" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png" width="1263" height="696" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?w=1263&amp;ssl=1 1263w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?resize=1024%2C564&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?resize=181%2C100&amp;ssl=1 181w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?resize=50%2C28&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moz.com-free-tools.png?resize=75%2C41&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p>
<p>Moz.com offers great free products like <a href="https://followerwonk.com/">FollowerWonk</a> and <a href="http://www.opensiteexplorer.org/">Open Site Explorer</a>. These are regularly shared as they are extremely <strong>practical</strong>, improving the Moz.com product range and bringing in new traffic. It&rsquo;s a no-brainer to share free tools like Open Site Explorer when they provide such great value.</p>
<p>HubSpot are another B2B example. Their <a href="http://marketing.grader.com/">Marketing Grader</a> has long been a tool that packs a punch for online marketers. HubSpot&rsquo;s marketing grader is massively popular, with nearly 5,000 back links, over 17,000 Facebook likes and 3,000 direct Twitter shares. Not bad for a tool pitched at B2B marketers that is funnelling you toward a product that costs more than $800/month.</p>
<p>For a non-B2B example we should look no further than one of 2013&rsquo;s most explosive mobile apps, <a href="http://tinder.com">Tinder</a>.</p>
<p>Tinder is technically a subsidiary of IAC, maker of Match.com and owner of OkCupid.com. When you look at it with this in mind, Tinder takes on a whole new perspective: it&rsquo;s a gateway drug for Match.com and OkCupid.com, IAC&rsquo;s revenue-driving properties.</p>
<p>IAC CEO Gregory Blatt recently said in <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-05/dating-app-tinder-catches-fire#p2">BusinessWeek</a>:</p>
<p>[external_quote the_quote=&rdquo;The more people we can get to try these services, whether we own them or not, the more likely they are to use our other services.&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GregBlatt.jpeg&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Greg Blatt&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://iac.com/&rdquo;]</p>
<p>This might explain why Tinder is focused so heavily on growth and not revenue. Launched earlier in the year, Tinder has clocked up 13 <strong>billion</strong> swipe-ratings (whether you think someone is hot or not, basically), and that was in September.</p>
<p>With over 500 million actual matches, Tinder is the fastest growing dating app and is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>

<p>By taking a new angle, IAC has, in essence, been able to build a &acirc;&#128;&#152;free tool&rsquo; which provides their core products with new leads. It also increases the appeal of online dating for an entirely new audience: one that doesn&rsquo;t want to fill out forms of &acirc;&#128;&#152;demographic&rsquo; questions and isn&rsquo;t as &acirc;&#128;&#152;serious&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Growth tip:</strong> How can you bolster your product offering by introducing a free tool that is <strong>useful</strong> and will get new potential customers interacting with and sharing your entire product range?</p>
<p>Developing a quality free tool is a great way to generate new traffic and leads if you already have an audience you can leverage and a product you can sell.</p>
<h2>3. Generate business from your customers&rsquo; customers</h2>
<p>Using your own customers to advertise your business to their networks is possibly the most powerful way to generate more business.</p>
<p>The base of all &acirc;&#128;&#152;viral&rsquo; growth, customer-to-customer advertising is extremely difficult to engineer.</p>
<p>The route to take totally depends on your business model.</p>
<p>Alex, founder of online help desk and chat software <a href="http://groovehq.com/blog/first-year">GrooveHQ</a> shares how he surveyed new customers and found that over 50% of new signups reported they had found Groove after seeing the Groove chat widget <strong>on other websites</strong>.</p>
<p>In light of this, they implemented a &acirc;&#128;&#152;Powered by Groove&rsquo; stamp on their chat widget:</p>

<p>Visitors that come via this widget are <strong>4 times more likely</strong> to convert to paid customers than those that don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>[quote the_quote=&rdquo;Referrals are our best source of new customers, hands down. It may not be our biggest channel, but trial users who come in through referral channels are more likely to convert, more likely to stay with Groove, and more likely to refer us to others. The referrers have already done the hardest job &mdash; getting their friends to give Groove a try. All we have to do is deliver.&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/alex-t.png&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Alex Turnbull&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://groovehq.com/blog&rdquo;]</p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;but not all businesses have the luxury of leveraging their customers&rsquo; websites. Most of us have to think outside the box.</p>
<p>Finding ways to generate word of mouth marketing is the focus. More traditional methods such as loyalty offers or discounts work well. <a href="http://getambassador.com">Ambassador</a> has helped businesses large and small harness the power of word of mouth with it&rsquo;s platform for referral-based marketing. Co-Founder Jeff shares his thoughts:</p>
<p>[quote the_quote=&rdquo;Word of mouth works. Ambassador has helped businesses such as SaaS startups generate hundreds of thousands in LTV and established brands (such as T-Mobile &amp; Chegg) leverage their customers to drive hundreds of referrals a day.&rdquo; image=&rdquo;/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jeff_Epstein.jpg&rdquo; name=&rdquo;Jeff Epstein&rdquo; link=&rdquo;http://getambassador.com&rdquo;]</p>
<p>For something a little more out of the ordinary, Ryan Hoover recently blogged about <a>a subtle product marketing tactic from Shazam</a>. If you try to identify a song with the iOS or Android app on your phone and Shazam can&rsquo;t determine what it is, it asks you to <strong>hold your phone closer to the source</strong>, generally prompting the user to raise their hand in the air or just generally stand out.</p>
<p>This creates word-of-mouth marketing, at the very least encouraging your immediate group of friends to ask what on earth you&rsquo;re up to.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png"><img data-attachment-id="1253" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/get-more-customers-growth-hacking/shazam/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?fit=973%2C533&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="973,533" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="shazam" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?fit=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?fit=973%2C533&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1253" alt="shazam" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png" width="973" height="533" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?w=973&amp;ssl=1 973w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?resize=183%2C100&amp;ssl=1 183w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?resize=50%2C27&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shazam.png?resize=75%2C41&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"></a></p>
<p>The idea of <strong>engineering</strong> word-of-mouth isn&rsquo;t new at all. Gyms are a fantastic example of a bricks-and-mortar business that uses merchandise to encourage word-of-mouth. Many gyms will include a bag, drink bottle or other visible accessory as a sign-on bonus.</p>
<p>This might seem warm and fuzzy but the truth is that this <a href="http://www.vernoncompany.com/why-do-promotional-products-work/">merchandise contributes strongly</a> to the brand and advertising for the gym. Furthermore they extend the lifetime value of customers.</p>
<p>Some basic statistics: 88% of people recall the brand on promotional products they receive (increased brand awareness), 59% of recipients have a more positive view of the provider after receiving a promotional product (people buy from people they like), 53% of recipients use at least one promotional item per week (continuing exposure to your brand).</p>
<p>It seems fair to argue that this strategy is effective. Promotional products have been around for decades and with these sorts of statistics it&rsquo;s not hard to see why.</p>
<p><strong>Growth tip:</strong> how can you get your customers to share your business with their networks. Perhaps you could leverage merchandise (a tried and true tactic), build in functionality that encourages your customers to visually or electronically share (the holy grail!) or leverage every aspect of face time you get with your customers (like Groove above).</p>
<h2>What you can do next</h2>
<p>These three strategies should all give you ideas on how you can get more customers consistently and scalable:</p>
<ol><li>Acquire a company or product that can expand your product suite, bring more customers and make you more money overnight.</li>
<li>Build a tool or product that generates shares and buzz. Make it <strong>useful</strong> and you&rsquo;ll see consistent traffic seeking out your business.</li>
<li>Harness the power of word-of-mouth, using <strong>your customers</strong> and their connections to create more business.</li>
</ol><p>The best thing you can do next is ask your customers two questions:</p>
<p>a. How did they find your business?<br>
b. What is their biggest problem / biggest wish using your product right now?</p>
<p>Looking at these answers (particularly the trends) can reveal ideas you can build from to find a product to test with your current customer base or encourage word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>So &ndash; what marketing &acirc;&#128;&#152;hack&rsquo; will you try next?</p></body></html>

<p>Better yet, a triggered email with <strong>2 or 3 links is 120% more likely to convert</strong> than one with just a single link.</p>
<p>Last week we examined <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/increase-email-click-through-rates/">whether emails with an image</a> converted better than those without. This week we examined over 8,000 campaigns to find some super-practical tips on whether <strong>newsletters or triggered emails </strong>get more click throughs and why.</p>
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<ul><li>We compared hard data from newsletter (blast) campaigns and triggered (transactional) campaigns. We&rsquo;re lucky in that not many ESPs have data that spans both of these campaign types but we do.</li>
<li>95% of our triggered emails are specifically setup for marketing purposes (as opposed to being receipts or system announcements) giving this data a very relevant perspective.</li>
<li>We only looked at &acirc;&#128;&#152;true&rsquo; links (we removed &acirc;&#128;&#152;View online&rsquo; and unsubscribe links as well as their related click values).</li>
<li>The ~8,000 campaigns used were a subset of those we&rsquo;ve sent on behalf of our customers, picked at random.</li>
</ul><p><span id="more-1156"></span></p>
<h1>Triggered email wins every time</h1>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3802?token=zSM3nsW4kL3P-XUC33cAL3MuewF1DTOrdz0nOQhfrQeqveoR_Zmw4Wqa_MjVHP704EkRs7AWva57vYjGsoDICVc" alt="Click rate triggered email"></p>
<p><strong>Triggered emails</strong> are 42% more likely to be clicked than <strong>newsletter campaigns</strong>.</p>
<p>Whilst this is clear from the data above, the real question is what we can get from this data. What information can you use to to make more informed decisions in the future. Here are two key hypotheses:</p>
<ul><li>Triggered emails sent from Vero are usually triggered by things such as user sign up, user inactivity, a previous purchase or a similar event. These are all highly engaged activities with a lot of &acirc;&#128;&#152;context&rsquo;. In many instances the customer is potentially &acirc;&#128;&#152;expecting&rsquo; an email (e.g. it&rsquo;s becoming fairly standard to send out a series of emails as part of a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/setup-automated-saas-welcome-campaign/">SaaS welcome series</a> and in all cases these emails speak directly to the customer about something relevant <strong>at that specific point in time</strong>. They&rsquo;re also segmented virtually one-to-one.</li>
<li>Newsletters do not perform terribly and Vero&rsquo;s customers seem to do well. Many newsletters target at <strong>least</strong> two segments which suggests that Vero customers are <strong>actively</strong> <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/send-a-targeted-newsletter-campaign/">breaking down their customer-base into relevant segments</a>. This too increases context which, in turn, increases click-through rates. By comparison, Mailchimp suggests their average click-through rate (globally) is around 3%. Segmentation works!</li>
</ul><h2>Does the number of links matter?</h2>
<p>We went one step further and analysed whether the number of links in a transactional email had any impact.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3803?token=n_AThY_caZ768RoJfzzDNEx4f-YiC22nRADknGHSJRmrJJE5oLfiGukitPCsn9IBIztdIBNwHFjX0ZFOQcP8NQ8" alt="Link count click rate"></p>
<p>It turns out it does and that 2-3 links in the email is the sweet-spot to increase click through rates.</p>
<p>In all instance <strong>emails with more than one link have a higher click rate</strong> that those with only one.</p>
<p>Based on some qualitative review, many triggered emails use a simple HTML template format that includes a logo at the top or link in the footer back to their senders&rsquo; website. Out of 2 or 3 links, this counts for at least one link. It appears likely that emails with 2-3 links are those that truly have a <strong>single call to action</strong> in the actual body of the email.</p>
<p>Campaigns with 4 or more links (the maximum was just above 30) are generally of a slightly different nature and have a different goal. Rather than being a personal email or a highly focused one they often have product recommendations or variations that encourage the user to click through sheer volume.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Yin and the team at <a href="http://www.launchbit.com/" target="blank">LaunchBit</a> pulled together a <a>bunch of statistics on email click rates and link counts</a>. They found all sorts of things but certainly that digest-style newsletters (correllating to our data on campaigns with more than 4 links) had a much higher click through rate than those of other formats.</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of links you have in an email newsletter affects the click-through-rate on the primary link that you want people to click.</p>
<p>In other words, if you have a link you really want people to click, it isn&rsquo;t enough to place it at the top of your emails in a prominent place. Reducing the number of other links that you have elsewhere in the email improves your click-through-rate on that top priority link.</p>
<p><cite class="person small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/elizabeth-yin.jpg" alt=""><a href="http://www.launchbit.com" target="blank">Elizabeth Yin</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The number of links <strong>definitely</strong> has a big impact on the click-through rate. Emails with 2-3 links convert at a rate that is 120% better than those with just one and 46% better than those with 4 or more.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Triggered emails get more clicks than newsletters</strong>: there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>That means you should leverage every chance you get to send <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/making-email-better-building-the-mixpanel-for-email/">triggered emails</a> and harness them as a marketing opportunity.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t send newsletters. If you segment correctly you still achieve really high click through rates and there are obviously so many opportunities to use newsletters to your advantage.</p>
<p>In the case of transactional emails its also important to plan and test different styles of email and focus on the number of links: having one or two key links tops is the key to success for triggered emails.</p>

<html><body><ul><li>Seasonal emails are a great opportunity to engage with customers, new and old.</li>
<li>It is also a great time to <strong>gather new data</strong> that you can use in all of your email campaigns over the next year.</li>
<li><strong>Segmentation</strong> is the key to driving conversions this Christmas. Learn from these three segmentation strategies.</li>
</ul><p>The holiday season lasts from November to January. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/holiday-email-marketing/" target="_blank">Making sure your email marketing is up to scratch</a> (and in line with what your customers are expecting) is a must.</p>
<p>If you want to drive conversions you need to send emails that are &lsquo;congruent&rsquo;. Emails that entice the recipient to engage. Segmentation is the key to help you build this congruency.<br>
Christmas is the busiest time of the year for customers&rsquo; inboxes, avoid the blanket approach and use targeted, data rich segments to provide relevant content and offers.</p>
<p>First up, here are the key dates to (typically) drive sales. Use these as central points for email campaigns:</p>
<p>Thanksgiving &ndash; 28 Nov<br>
Black Friday &ndash; 29 Nov<br>
Cyber Monday &ndash; 2 Dec<br>
Boxing Day &ndash; 26 Dec</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> when you send an email you&rsquo;re talking to <strong>real people</strong>! Not just numbers. Treat your recipients as you&rsquo;d like to be treated.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s three <strong>email segmentation strategies</strong> to make your campaigns more relevant:</p>
<p><span id="more-1146"></span></p>

Receive a practical email marketing idea for the holiday season in your inbox each week for the next 7 weeks. Unsubscribe at any time!&rdquo; link=&rdquo;&rdquo;]</p>
<h2>1. Split customers based on their purchase behavior last year</h2>
<p>Dump your sales data from last holiday season and use this to plan a targeted campaign.</p>
<p>Here are three things every online business should be able to dig up on each customer that purchased last year:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Did they buy a gift or something for themselves?</strong> For example: if a male customer purchased a dress, it&rsquo;s likely it was a gift.</li>
<li><strong>Did they purchase during a sale?</strong> For example: if they purchased using a coupon code on Boxing Day, you can segment them as shoppers who responded to a discount.</li>
<li><strong>Did they purchase using a gift card?</strong> For example: if they purchased using a gift card or offer that identifies them as having <em>received</em> a gift from another customer.</li>
</ol><p>Obviously this is the tip of the iceberg but this information will let you send smarter emails that convert better. One email you could send with the above information is inspired by ASOS. Send an offer on any of your sale dates to the segment of customers that purchased during a sale last year:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3384?token=V3zP15zt3RuDizNlR0L65l7cEp_HzXD94IGtf4TIAL8I1ytBel0sPnVhHrjOJzlNcy78g3r_KPXZ5du3lidqmtM" alt=""></p>
<p>Alternately you could single out those customers you&rsquo;ve identified above as purchasing a gift for someone else last year. This email from Netflix shows how it&rsquo;s done. Simple, to the point and effective.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3382?token=8CCUpogqkk8DV8VgvguyiJ0DJRvps0Kmy9tGijsoZLkeY9FwnJvk6A5aWfgUorwqUlhSQySWidtF0LMcvr2aCVY" alt=""></p>
<p>Netflix provides inspiration for another email you could send: segment out <strong>loyal shoppers</strong> (customers that have spent at least $X or purchased Y times) and give them something special, to create loyalty:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3381?token=d_xj1xFgdEIYP0Vh0-sxiMWkuxqv1TZQDZXpSvpgCyxp9DZnGSBXHNz9qmIeVJduuaU3zASU9BFlgKyaodu4amk" alt=""></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 25px; background: #f6e99e; border: 1px solid #e5d681; padding: 15px 20px;">
<p>Setting up a segment like this is easy with the right tools:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="575px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png"><img data-attachment-id="1151" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-marketing-holidays/easy-segment/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?fit=1022%2C455&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1022,455" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="easy-segment" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?fit=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?fit=1022%2C455&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1151" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png" alt="easy-segment" width="575" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?w=1022&amp;ssl=1 1022w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?resize=300%2C134&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?resize=225%2C100&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?resize=50%2C22&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/easy-segment.png?resize=75%2C33&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;"><a href="/">Learn more about sending targeted newsletters with Vero &acirc;&#134;&#146;</a></p>
</div>
<p>The holy grail is to go one step further and get <strong>really</strong> specific. If you were Warby Parker and knew which customers had a flex spending account you&rsquo;d be smart and send something like this:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3380?token=DG6jMEnEkqwZhKDY-4eXUsYMKmPER0eRvdXdAtppej3Y21l1ahGaWIjyKvy0DtR92cD61DGzP2b4LAthDE7SX34" alt=""></p>
<p>Think outside the box.</p>
<h5>To do:</h5>
<p>Use information you&rsquo;ve gathered in the past to create segments of customers that are actually relevant. Don&rsquo;t simply hit &lsquo;send to everyone&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>2. React to actions as they happen</h2>
<p>The next segmentation strategy involves reacting to actions <strong>this year</strong>, <strong>as they happen</strong>.</p>
<p>A big component of getting this right is targeted, automated campaigns that literally send to customers on a one-to-one basis. Take this example from Dolphin Music. Rather than sending your standard cart abandonment emails you should rework your campaigns. To replicate this example you would setup trigger an email to customers that begin checkout but don&rsquo;t complete it in the last month before Christmas:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3379?token=XhDN5ruH65Tk-hy8l-9fftcZC0HITQSVIQclldE2ljD4L_vaZap0yc6gC8Z0BMMwPArYrtHBCuP2xrAaEYOTL0k" alt=""></p>
<p>Another approach would be to send out a campaign around the 20th of December to any customer that has added a product to their cart in the last 6 weeks and has not purchased:</p>
<p>These sorts of &lsquo;last minute&rsquo; campaigns are a simple way to retarget customers and they represent value as thy are <strong>very specifically</strong> targeted at customers that <strong>have</strong> left things to the last minute.</p>
<p>What about customers that <strong>do</strong> purchase between November and December? Segment them out and send them a thank you email and an offer encouraging them to do more shopping and buy another gift or purchase again before the holiday season is over:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3378?token=prvp4epBjW8mgUo7a30lqaPbNzQ-cFck75By8YXNer3Sr4Fd9p_d5zGCaeLtmxDQ_pvQr1UvS5juHZoWszA16O4" alt=""></p>
<p>This final example from Expedia is <strong>really powerful</strong>. By tracking users who viewed their website using a mobile device <strong>after Christmas</strong> last year they created a very targeted segment and send them an email promoting the Expedia mobile apps:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3375?token=hsKzEzMB3CaaS9FHOcy5G0jDAavDSirncH64a9r73qPb08d0L5jHaKBx9kiH2x4Rd2khjFC8I6s6rNPsogQUwrg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is an amazing example of segmentation. It does two things: 1. targets consumers who are excited about their new iPad/Android/iPhone, and 2. targets consumers who are possibly preparing for a holiday in the cold winter months!</p>
<p><strong>To do:</strong> Use customer actions <strong>as they happen</strong> over the holiday season to create segments and really drive relevant email campaigns.</p>
<h2>3. Localize, localize, localize</h2>
<p>This is the simplest of the strategies so I&rsquo;ve left it to last.</p>
<p>It can be easy to get &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; on some of the advanced ideas above so starting with some basic segmentation might be the key for you.</p>
<p>The most basic of basic segmentation strategies during the holiday season is to use your customers&rsquo; location. Customers experience the holiday season in different ways in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>A simple example: thanksgiving is a North American celebration. It&rsquo;s not celebrated in the UK, Europe, Australia or Asia. It would be a bit silly to waste precious sends sending a Thanksgiving offer to all of these customers!</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that simple though. Take inspiration from Kate Spade. This email targets North American customers that are more than likely to travel somewhere over the holidays.</p>
<p>This email capitalises on this fact by mentioning many of the likely holiday destinations &ndash; it&rsquo;s well targeted to their audience too: not <strong>everyone</strong> goes to Aspen after all ;). This sort of context is what really drives conversions:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/3374?token=rFVh3aRRUGe9xFQq7b-gsixS5erL1UVLjjyMhd57bn8Y4T8plQy7MDusHwqtCLa49eTvR-ecv31ZVK-6Bqm4-TA" alt="KATE SPADE"></p>
<h5>To do:</h5>
<p>Use location as a basic segment and think about the context of your customers. Where do they live? Is it hot or cold? Are they likely to travel? Do they even celebrate some of the holiday &lsquo;key dates&rsquo;? Make every email count.</p>
<h2>Happy Holidays!</h2>
<p>These segmentation strategies give a good overview of where to begin segmenting this holiday seasons. The key takeaway is: you&rsquo;ve got an extremely small opportunity to engage your customers&rsquo; attention at this time of year as their inbox is <strong>overflowing</strong>. Segment to ensure customers don&rsquo;t receive endless emails from you and that every email they <strong>do receive</strong> is as contextual and as powerful as it can be.</p>

<html><body><ol><li>Selling B2B SaaS or physical products at scale is no different to selling B2C products.</li>
<li>If you have a B2C product then you should consider a B2B product as a growth offering &ndash; lifecycle email can help you maximize your conversions here.</li>
<li>Treating your customers as individuals and acknowleding their use-cases is the most effective thing you can do. Use data-driven segments!</li>
</ol><p>The internet has changed the way software is sold. Now businesses can sell to tens or hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people with a small team and a scalable infrastructure. This has blurred the lines between B2C products and B2B products.</p>
<p>Companies like Github, Atlassian, SlideShare, Apple and 37Signals and others have many individual or small-time customers and leverage these to sell expensive, valuable products to larger customers &ndash; they all make a lot of  money doing so. Similarly, companies like Yammer and LinkedIn take social or consumer-driven ideas into the business space.</p>
<p>The four tactics below catalog <strong>email marketing campaigns that B2B online businesses use to drive conversions</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1092"></span></p>
<h2>1. Organisations <em>are</em> an advertising channel</h2>
<p>Organisations are essentially giant networks. People are constantly communicating: sitting in open-plan offices, sending each other emails, chatting over lunch, going to meetings. These are opportunities for true word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re selling business software into organizations with more than just a handful of employees then you should consider building out funnels that encourage the sharing of your product within the organization.</p>
<p>For example, Mixpanel offer all of their customers, no matter what plan they&rsquo;re on, the ability to invite colleagues to their application at any time:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="547px"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/mixpanel-team-member.png" width="547" height="294"></p>
<p>At first it may seem a little strange: team member management is often reserved for enterprise customers. In this case though, it is a great strategy. Mixpanel has many large customers and the more individuals that interact with Mixpanel&rsquo;s software, the better. Earlier this year we blogged about the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/viral-marketing-email/">amazing success of a campaign that specifically encouraged inter-office sharing</a> run by Userlicious. The results of that campaign were a lift in revenues of 35%.</p>
<p>The marginal cost of supporting multiple logins means that any incremental revenue that comes via this channel is virtually pure profit &ndash; the acquisition costs are nearly zero. How many Mixpanel users have partners, friends or family that could benefit from Mixpanel? How many work with other companies that could benefit from Mixpanel?</p>
<p>Yammer provide another great example of a B2B product that utilises inter-office sharing for growth. Someone in the organization has to sign up to Yammer. After confirming their account the first thing they see is an option to &lsquo;invite others to their Yammer network&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This sort of virality is important as a growth channel. Here&rsquo;s the Yammer flow in pictures:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yammer-welcome-flow.jpg" width="1013" height="1400"></p>
<p>Yammer&rsquo;s use of email to complete the signup flow and encourage rapid adoption of the platform within a new organization is a great example of how important it is to consider <strong>all</strong> channels for marketing your products.</p>
<p><strong>Think about how you can encourage your business customers to &lsquo;share&rsquo; your product with their colleagues whilst providing value at the same time.</strong></p>
<h2>2. Speak their language and treat business customers as special</h2>
<p>Selling hundreds of millions of devices a year, Apple has massive reach &ndash; both with consumer and business customers.</p>
<p>Whilst Microsoft reigned as the business platform of choice for decades, Apple now accounts for 90% of all business tablet activations and 72% of all mobile device activations. They have a lot of experience selling into businesses and know an insane amount about their customers. Ever been into an Apple store and swiped your card? They know what you&rsquo;ve bought before &ndash; it&rsquo;s on the screen in front of them!</p>
<p>When it comes to email marketing, Apple are good at two things:</p>
<ol><li>Cross-selling business products to non-business customers.</li>
<li>Selling more business products to existing business customers</li>
</ol><p>Dialling in on the second point, Apple creates segments based on past purchase history and browsing habits. This reduces the pool of recipients for each of it&rsquo;s email campaigns to a targeted selection that is more likely to convert. Since they know exactlyw hat you&rsquo;ve bought in the past they&rsquo;re very good at getting business customers to buy again and again. Take this newsletter introducing new Macs to business customers:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="500px"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/apple-store-new-macs.png" width="500" height="1129"></p>
<p>Similarly these ads for iPads and iPhones as work devices directly target business customers. It is segmentation and strategy like this that has pushed Apple further-and-further into small, medium and large businesses &ndash; overtaking Blackberry and Microsoft in the minds of most:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="526px"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ipad-business.jpg" width="526" height="171"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/iphone-business.png" width="927" height="449"></p>
<p>This examples employ the perfect sort of segmentation to get <strong>current</strong> business customers that looking to enhance their offering to purchase again.</p>
<p>By tracking past purchases or purchase intent you too can increase the ROI on each campaign you send. A few simple ideas you could try include targeting &ldquo;Loyal customers&rdquo; for those that have purchased multiple times or have been around for a certain period of time, &ldquo;Browsed page X&rdquo; for those that have shown interested in a particular feature or section of your site and &ldquo;Purchased product X&rdquo; for lucrative remarketing opportunities. If you&rsquo;re selling online software you should also break down segments by the technology each customer uses. What operating system do they use? Have they got a mobile? These are valuable questions.</p>
<p><strong>What campaigns can you send that acknowledge your business customers are &lsquo;special&rsquo;? </strong></p>
<h2>3. Convert freemium consumers to business customers</h2>
<p>Further to Apple&rsquo;s data-driven segmentation above, if you offer a &lsquo;Pro&rsquo; or business offering or features you can leverage your non-business customers as a pool of potential leads. This is, of course, easier said than done, so here are some approaches.</p>
<p>Take Slideshare: despite having millions of casual consumers Slideshare makes its revenues from &lsquo;Pro&rsquo; accounts. These are accounts with distinctly business features. As in the example below, if you post a slidedeck on Slideshare that visitors can download for free and a customer <em>does</em> download it, Slideshare use this user-generated trigger to remind you of their Pro feature:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="608px"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/slideshare-collecting-leads.png" width="608" height="469"></p>
<p>This use of automation creates a great opportunity to upsell free users as it targets customers that have just had success with Slideshare.</p>
<p>Similarly, they send the following email if your slides go &lsquo;viral&rsquo; and trend on the homepage:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/slideshare.png" width="1006" height="928"></p>
<p>Again, the aim is to convert customers that have seen immense success with Slideshare whilst they&rsquo;re on a high-note. The use of trigger-based emails is again extremely effective here.</p>
<p>LinkedIn use similar tactics. Their Pro accounts give you advanced features you&rsquo;re likely to use a sales person or recruiter. They regularly send out targeted offers to customers that have shown intent to upgrade. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="410px"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/linkedin-premium-upgrade.png" width="410" height="337"></p>
<p>These concepts work extremely effectively for Slideshare and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>As they have such a large pool of potential new business and Pro customers, this tactic is a no-brainer, but the concept can be applied to your own business. The core idea is to identify activities customers take that leave them feeling <strong>positive</strong> and use those lifecycle events to trigger campaigns that very specificallyt arget them.</p>
<p><strong>What can customers do when interacting with your business that you can use to convert them to paid (or more expensive) product(s)?</strong></p>
<h2>4. Create lock-in opportunities</h2>
<p>37Signals has over a million users. They are certainly pioneers in their approach to online business tuning the selling of their software into a truly low-touch process. Just like Slideshare and LinkedIn, 37Signals have free features. No doubt there are many thousands of individuals using their products to tinker on a side-project or keep basic to-do lists, with no intention to upgrade.</p>
<p>However, these same customers may work in other organizations or on other projects for which there <strong>is</strong> value in 37Signals&rsquo; paid products. On top of the lifecycle email approach discussed above, Basecamp use announcements about their extension marketplace to drive greater retention, better product adoption and new conversions. Most of these extensions are other paid apps and most are business-focused and this strengthens the value of 37Signals&rsquo; core products and <strong>gives customers a reason to upgrade:</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/basecamp-partner-page.png" width="652" height="441"></p>
<p>This creates a two-way flow. For example, by marketing these extensions to <em>free users</em> 37Signals increase the liklihood these customers will stick with the Basecamp platform for longer and, most importantly, educate these free users on the full capabilities of the product: many of which might appeal to these same users in a business context, leading them to upgrade.</p>
<p>The marketplace also creates increased lock-in from <strong>current business customers</strong> which leads to meaningful upgrades as they use more and more of the features and projects, much like Apple&rsquo;s approach above.</p>
<p>Salesforce is the originator of this concept. Salesforce&rsquo;s AppExchange marketplace is so powerful that many successful businesses are built simply on the back of it. It&rsquo;s success has helped ensure the longevity and supreme reign of Salesforce as the world&rsquo;s leading CRM. This allows Salesforce to focus on core functionality, make more money as customers stick around for longer and increase their success with &lsquo;expansion revenue&rsquo; from up-sells and cross-sells.</p>
<p>Atlassian are following suite with a marketplace that is growing rapidly. Here&rsquo;s an example of the regular updates Atlassian send to both small and large customers:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/atlassian-marketplace.jpg" width="650" height="858"></p>
<p>Creating this two-way growth channel is a tried-and-true strategy if you have the scale and a product that can integrate with other useful services.</p>
<p><strong>How can you build a marketplace or create at least one integration or extension for your product that strengthens your customers&rsquo; relationships with your business</strong>.</p>
<p>Get consumer-focused users switching to business accounts, get them to stick around longer and get them to pay more!</p>
<h2>Make more money</h2>
<p>The ideas in this post are not new and we&rsquo;ve discussed many of them before on this blog <strong>but</strong> it is extremely powerful to study the tactics in B2B scenarios and powerful to see the ideas some of the largest online software providers in the world are selling.</p>

<html><body><p>These five email strategies from the worlds largest media sites like Tumblr will help you increase user engagement and conversion too.</p>
<p>Tumblr sites get over <strong>20 billion page views per month</strong>.</p>
<p>Online media is changing rapidly. Whilst old-world media outlets and newspapers rapidly try to work out how to stay relevant and monetize in an online world, ad networks and new-age media like Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest are exploding.</p>
<p>One thing in all of this is clear: savvy, successful publishers <strong>understand the power of email</strong> to increase user engagement, readership and revenue.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>five email marketing tactics you can learn from the best in the publishing industry</strong>.</p>
<p>You can apply each of them your own business, no matter what you sell.</p>
<p><span id="more-1086"></span></p>
<h2>1. Personalization, personalisation, personalisation</h2>
<p>The name of the game in publishing is to serve customers articles they want to read.</p>
<p>Ensuring customers are engaged and the maximum amount of time on your site means more advertising revenue. New-age publishers like Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest really lead the charge when it comes to email personalisation.</p>
<p>Tumblr&rsquo;s <em>recommendation</em> newsletters are a great example of A/B testing at work. Their variations range from the visually dynamic (this was an animated GIF):</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Automated email Tumblr trending" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2610?token=27Abu6Bx1DUdpSUHPgjcEBWVQVcW1VuG4d_ny7ItSRcJZTxoI7G7u4DShUdlt3V3IGkTELfx8u44tG9o1YUXKgM"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;to the experimental:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Behavioral email campaign Tumblr Go" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2609?token=uDxaYdJMPc7d66NLu-6BJlkrrTHIjKzBHh5hBmSpGOUWttqLgMnhXMo809UaEW9TqYC43HoGqS4ytdJ6Rf9rbFY"></p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter use your followers, people you follow and trending data to recommend new tweets that are personally relevant to you:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter what is trending email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2608?token=HW5vn9WQ-nCQWFUetwh4UM_l7tQYkVpTsuhtQemSvRmReyPgfgvGl4Jz6yBV69Ju-rhhWlACTwFGzvOq9Q5l4dM"></p>
<p>The point of the this campaign is to get you more engaged in Twitter, to ensure you spend more time on the site and, of course, to get you to generate more awesome content.</p>
<p>To round out examples of personalisation, Pinterest recently sent this email to our inbox, a great example of how targeted you can be:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Pinterest targeted email marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2607?token=6hNRlE6fahMPx2qyiqbLbSvX35eIJtjfVaMzc7CX6XRkkwUR3MZHOEm3OihACOMUJIniRBZ8sd6hXnEcErSuDTs"></p>
<p>Personalization based on customer actions on your site and their interactions with your content is the holy grail (like the above).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to achieve but Pinterest and others show that with the right tools it can be achieved.</p>
<h2>4. Roll out the red carpet for new customers</h2>
<p>Publishers like DailyCandy and Nerdiest make tens of millions of dollars a year, primarily thanks to their large subscriber databases.</p>
<p>Just like eCommerce stores and SaaS businesses, your customers&rsquo; initial experience with your business is a vital one.</p>
<p>SIgn up is your best (perhaps only) chance to truly impress your customers. It&rsquo;s the perfect time to welcome and educate.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailycandy.com">DailyCandy</a> send out a welcome email like the one below. It&rsquo;s a fantastic example of great email copy. It has the right tone, perfectly representing DailyCandy&rsquo;s brand, such as <em>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re the only one with bills to pay?&rdquo;</em>. Plus, it aims to make the recipient feel special: <em>You&rsquo;re one of us now.</em></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Welcome email DailyCandy" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2606?token=XEHvepybIQ4AVHI8XHAF1qQTT2z_Y00Ao5ySzZjurqDG9QMrg5sG6C09-6wUPIIyeJBF6w9j17yZfNYaSqOQiWo"></p>
<p><a href="http://nerdist.com">Nerdist</a> do a similar thing, welcoming new users. They make it clear that a) they can unsubscribe at any time and that b) they should add Nerdist to their contact book. Both smart tactics: being open and honest about unsubscription helps build an engaged list whilst getting into your customer&rsquo;s address book increases deliverability rates.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Nerdist Welcome Email Campaign" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2605?token=MekstglPCNWusx6WaoSi8VclmVRpbLkYLp7JFDZ2OrjKhRjurRZOHDPAnY9tjhLtDVh6wypMXtESxEryUehOJ3E"></p>
<p>A great campaign idea, regardless of the industry, is to target new signups that haven&rsquo;t yet actually interacted with your site with a different strategy.</p>
<p>This sounds obvious but is done less than it deserves to be. These days it&rsquo;s super easy to track when a customer signs up and super easy to track all of their actions.</p>
<p>For example, rather than continuing to bombard customers that haven&rsquo;t interacted with your business you could this drastically different approach, like Fab.com:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Fab.com automatically unsubscribe customers" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2604?token=HDtHNxrRHDdAQJETEdZ_bXOCtbSBjlQMxlLkJHPAPdeFir1iBVge3wB153vltMNavRb-b-JKTNkkdjTYa1F6ZuM"></p>
<p>You should use the opportunity of targeting this segment as a golden chance to get them re-engaged in your product. If an email like the one from Fab above doesn&rsquo;t get attention then nothing will!</p>
<h2>3. Drive your customers to re-purchas wherever possible</h2>
<p>Online publishers make money via online advertising.</p>
<p>Some publishers control their own ad platforms whilst others earn revenue through intermediaries like Google AdSense. Google are extremely adept at using lifecycle email to get AdWords customers spending more.</p>
<p>Not only do Google focus on getting you activated with AdWords quickly:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="AdWords Welcome Email Campaign" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2603?token=-VGjz1yOfpHGWDubmrV_wxpnavdEXWYzIf9hyKWXEn0ZhlWF1pvBJ19YcSrl8zinopPTJB7X5UrzqaWTB_zlq-A"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;they also send you lifecycle emails at key points in your engagement with the product that focus on three things:</p>
<p>1) Keeping your account topped up,<br>
2) Getting you to create <strong>new</strong> ads,<br>
3) Ensuring your ads make you more and more money (increasing LTV).</p>
<p>All of these approaches aim for the same goal: increasing your spending on the network.</p>
<p>Their reminder emails are simple, like the one below:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="AdWords Email Running Low" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2602?token=COkEs87MjGShKYOeIzK0fchfPO4I09mnJ4lfbVKJFOtlXyx4-Erdy9wQXYWYuKEYvHXpNrpyLYwRr92IoqKdQIg"></p>
<p>Whilst their emails designed to get your creating more effective and diverse ads are a little more sophisticated:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="AdWords Email Try This Feature" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2600?token=PnASs42Xsj9pDBAuVRXzYO5poMwt2pUuB8sJBrfniARED1Xq6TAN9ULDlJ03xVeZyRR6jazco1Oy2xUezs1dgaw"></p>
<p>These emails work well as they use statistics and personalised content in conjunction with targeted events to convert recipients.</p>
<p>LinkedIn are increasingly a large publisher of user-generated content. They also run their own ad network.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example from LinkedIn that aims to get business users to start using their paid ads:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="LinkedIn Buy Ads" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2599?token=8qVWIoSyPUafectlV2bgHuX89fht-C3ahm6SuhPhgzFHZskBPDotzNdPYnyk6MsNlEmHn1dn3IaLCeTt16RwOec"></p>
<p>Twitter do something similar, letting their customers know about their new ad platform. This is an example of a great newsletter they sent that harnesses social proof and the recipient customer&rsquo;s own details to great success:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter Ad Platform Email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2598?token=jq2qXWtKRDIBbym-tTnA6jiWfjWYEo1oCDAujA6UKtMWOIynxOb4UYylEv0eeRgohxsbs7Z9mMjvfe-k2bDG74Q"></p>
<p>Perfect Audience are a Facebook and display retargeting platform that use email a <strong>lot</strong>. They use the power of psychology to make advertisers feel good, with emails like this &lsquo;conversion success&rsquo; notification:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Perfect Audience Conversions" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2597?token=Bm8i-cDFLpVR8Wt8n4wYIHGLatmPFrUBcqNJiXOU9MEDNFvVN3b8150RP1o6CCPItO3YMFusjn08KHsAX_cWc1I"></p>
<p>They also send out summary emails designed to emphasise the impact their platform is having on your business.</p>
<p>If you work with or manage your own advertising platform then email is an extremely effective tool to get your customers <strong>spending more for longer</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about striking the right tone and the right time. Data-driven segmentation is the key here.</p>
<h2>4. Social and email play nicely together</h2>
<p>Building on the Twitter example in part one, Twitter also use personalised data to recommend profiles you should follow:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter email people you know" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2596?token=jZAOo8xDWO0q7o6SPkAVcEpwBb_4Aql5O4dYYrtXpmetFyq83J7H7zkjTBNG029e_B_9XuYBPoZrX2JKb44MnLs"></p>
<p>Twitter makes great use of the extremely detailed data they have to give you recommendations that are relevant, keeping you on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitter is built around social, so this is only natural. Thinking about what you can do to encourage social sharing of your own content can begin with most basic social integration &ndash; Facebook and Twitter share or profile buttons in the sidebar:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Nerdist social email marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2595?token=GCvYrfB7Sb1NtHzj-44poUwPf6Ll0RnHAL-YARSa8tr5JtzfUvSJlp8ddBYnNR76rpJtIotacByuTDuxn24Ebdk"></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not doing this, then shame on you.</p>
<p>For an example of innovative thinking and a really interesting case of combining social data with publishing data comes from Disqus.</p>
<p>Disqus are not a publisher, per se, but they are an increasingly important part of the online blogging world and recommendations within that sphere.</p>
<p>Their digest emails connect you with the comments you&rsquo;ve made, where you&rsquo;ve made them and responses from other readers. This is an interesting subset of email marketing within the publishing world and food-for-thought on how you might use your own commenting system or recommendations to build a community:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Disqus digest email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2594?token=R5NINPbJpN7N8a8h-XcYTzYq5m6yRv78UMIgSDXXI-TcjEC_cUfmbvviIVRaeMdCR7_k4XHd75Q8QnntfIkW24w"></p>
<p>Always think outside the box!</p>
<p>Combining social data into the emails you&rsquo;re already sending makes sense: it gives you an instant increase in your reach by leveraging your readers&rsquo; networks.</p>
<h2>5. Advertise and cross-sell like crazy</h2>
<p>Advertising <strong>in</strong> email campaigns and cross-selling related products is something publishers are particularly good at.</p>
<p>Companies like DailyCandy have many promotional emails that directly reference product offers or sales. They do so in an editorial way, blurring the lines between direct selling and publishing.</p>
<p>Take this example selling Mara and Mine shoes:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="DailyCandy Shoes Offer Email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2593?token=zhJJCkcpMRcs5rD3fIln1UwIvaEckTARFALayosl46D36xAEbJ4aDDNgpLr9QZQl9m1J5CSg5hNLMbMe90QsU3Y"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;or this example for Dove deodorant:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="DailyCandy Email Marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2592?token=9VYP1bPsFt3S5oI-99266s3nj6OhQh7m2SXAdypLdHS6DUSmNWmgWdd_FWWwmVd1uZ6PMH9yDKTPR96LYUfB1Qo"></p>
<p>Segmenting your list and advertising <strong>related products</strong> to potentially interested consumers is a money-making machine.</p>
<p>Monocle, a UK-based paper magazine, is a savvy publisher too. They use their newsletter to sell their own branded products and to cross-promote content, partnerships and other tidbits from around their network:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Monocle Offer Email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2612?token=rcbvdhF9FaxV4PGNYfwB2_L-Cz5i1AcPNVsOkfitLxMO68WFmsg-7LpJY2amEcIePqai4BAAZhIraI7f-VHznfs"></p>
<p>Perhaps most effective (and even a little ironic <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the way Monocle use their email list to convert subscribers to their print magazine (the core of the business):</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Monocle Print Edition Offer Email Marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2589?token=v7ffhWINl0AjNUydKPe3rWPTnb0z8V5vmbtZsGgRqgWswjg4gpo_6vkYHxPykxVIYBH4PcQigXcKYWcFKBDCSQc"></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re employing the strategy of sending offers to your readers then your focus should be on segmentation. Without segmentation it&rsquo;s unlikely your cross-sell will lead to conversions, sales and revenue.</p>
<p>This tactic can work for anyone and in comes in many forms. Here&rsquo;s an example from Verizon:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Verizon up sell email marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2584?token=pl9KC9zo1YJ02PoRrfrRcHzy-AKI2gDm_Zy9_rm8rMWZztaZNPnUCtax4S08TPTtA12IgF-Pwje4omPJsROnmc0"></p>
<p>Another example of a subtle but effective upsell in an otherwise completely transactional email.</p>
<p>Think about each and every email you send as an opportunity to upsell and create &lsquo;expansion&rsquo; revenue for your business.</p>
<p>Think about what other features, products or content you can share to get customers more engaged with your business instantly.</p>
<h2>Publish your next campaign and profit</h2>
<p>The tips above come from some of the world&rsquo;s largest online publishers.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got millions to spend on testing and finding campaigns that convert customers.</p>
<p>So why not borrow these ideas for your next campaign? From welcome emails to segmented newsletters, these are ideas that any online business can benefit significantly from.</p>
<p>What campaign will you create next?</p></body></html>

<h2>1. A great targeted offer email</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/offer-on-subscription.png" alt="Targeted offer email newsletter" width="1003" height="1059"></p>
<p>This offer newsletter from Monocle is a great example of what <strong>segmentation can do for your newsletters</strong>. Targeted at previous subscribers who are no longer subscribed, this email combines a limited-time deal at a great price with a relevant audience. A formula for success.

<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/webinar-invite.png" alt="Webinar invite email marketing" width="813" height="1359"></p>
<p>Webinars are a powerful tool in any online marketer&rsquo;s arsenal. One of the challenges of webinars is that it can be difficult to get potential attendees to signup and even harder to get them to actually attend. SaaS business Pingdom does an amazing job with this webinar invite email. With bright colors, a simple selling proposition and great calls to action, this is an example of a webinar invitation we can all take inspiration from.<br><!--Start button--></p>

<h2>3. Freemium upgrade email with a targeted audience</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/free-pro-trial.png" alt="Upgrade freemium users with email" width="1007" height="900"></p>
<p>Converting freemium customers into paying customers is a challenging prospect. Getting the timing of an offer just right can significantly increase your conversion rates. Slideshare shows the power of behavioral email with this great campaign. Rather than offering <em>everyone</em> PRO membership they target customers who have had a slideshow go viral (even if it&rsquo;s just a little viral). This makes sense: after all, there&rsquo;s a much higher likelihood these customers will engage and see value in upgrading.<br><!--Start button--></p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sydney-traveller-deals.png" alt="Email marketing travel" width="1006" height="1072"></p>
<p>Travel is a vertical in which online businesses have a plethora of information on their customers. Who they are, where they are going and other detailed information gives online travel companies the power to do some special email marketing. This example from Flightfox targets flyers from Sydney and uses the fear of missing out to powerful effect. This campaign is a great example of mining your database for data you can use to create segments that will help increase conversions.<br><!--Start button--></p>
