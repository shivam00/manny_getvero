<html><body><p>You know the best way to send better email newsletters?</p>
<p>Subscribe to and read <em>lots</em> of them.</p>
<p>Here are 50 great ones to keep tabs on. These may not reach the widest audience <strong>but they resonate with the right audience</strong>. Some are niche, some are general &hellip; but all of them go above and beyond to deliver a great experience. They&rsquo;ve earned to right to be opened based on the sender, not the subject line. (If your emails are good enough over time, people will open them regardless of what the subject says.)</p>
<p>While the content may not be relevant to you, look for ideas on how to better communicate with your own subscribers. Some newsletters, like Help Scout&rsquo;s, contain a single link while other have more than 50. Some are beautifully designed while others have a community bulletin feel to them. There is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to do it, as long as it engages the reader.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy these newsletters. There are obviously more than 50 great ones out there so please let us know what we missed in the comments.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> I really mean when I say subscribe to all 50. I use a filter and label in my Gmail so most of these skip the inbox. When I need inspiration, I have a treasure trove of ideas waiting for me.</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">1. Help Scout</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s so popular in the marketing world that many of his foundational principles have become cliche. Still, his daily posts always inspire, and his consistency &ndash; he&rsquo;s been blogging since 2002 &ndash; is admirable in and of itself. Even though his newsletter is simply an RSS feed of his posts, it&rsquo;s worth collecting his genius in your inbox.</p>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/02/27-marketing-tips-thatll-woo-your-visitors-and-win-them-over/" target="_blank">27 Marketing Tips That&rsquo;ll Woo Your Visitors and Win Them Over</a></strong></p>
<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>6. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/guest-blogging" target="_blank">How We&rsquo;ve Reached More Than 1 Million People by Guest Blogging</a></strong></p>
<p>Is your time better spent writing for your own blog or someone else&rsquo;s? Rand Fishkin calls guest blogging a slippery slope, since you are giving away authority that could be your own. Groove&rsquo;s Alex Turnbull, however, suggests otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234689" target="_blank">10 of the Most Counterintuitive Pieces of Advice From Famous Entrepreneurs</a></strong></p>
<p>Advice from founders is invaluable, especially when it&rsquo;s really off the beaten path. Beth Belle Cooper asked 10 entrepreneurs for their most counterintuitive advice and uncovered some fascinating insights. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These days, however, I live without goals, for the most part. It&rsquo;s absolutely liberating, and contrary to what you might have been taught, it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop achieving things.</p>
<p>It means you stop letting yourself be limited by goals.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/improve-your-email-marketing-today/">6 Ways You Can Improve Your Email Marketing TODAY</a></strong></p>
<p>Why wait until tomorrow? Here are some very actionable tips you can put to good use right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Create an inbox swipe file.</li>
<li>Find every customer touch point.</li>
<li>Send an A/B test.</li>
<li>Learn to write better copy.</li>
<li>Segment your lists.</li>
<li>Upgrade your toolbox.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><strong>10. <a href="http://blog.leadpages.net/landing-pages-apple-borrow-apples-best-copywriting-techniques-copy/" target="_blank">Landing Pages by Apple</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for tips on creating landing pages that convert like crazy, why not look at one of the most successful companies in the world? Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about craftsmanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about placing you, the customer, squarely in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong>11. <a href="http://blog.qz.com/post/82007790924/how-we-doubled-our-email-sign-up-rate-by-reducing" target="_blank">How we doubled our email sign-up rate by reducing friction</a></strong></p>
<p>This post appeared on Quartz, one of my favorite sites, a few months ago but it&rsquo;s a great reminder that reducing friction is one of the best ways to drive conversions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since we rolled out the new system on February 19, our daily subscriber rate has doubled, even on weekends when activity dips considerably. Users can now sign up via &ldquo;in-stream units&rdquo; (pictured above) or through the Daily Brief landing page. Of the people that view that page, a full 60% of them now go on to subscribe. In the chart below, you can see the noticeable effects these small tweaks have made to our growth.</p>

<p><strong>12. <a href="http://sparksheet.com/secret-social-network-ama-reddits-erik-martin/" target="_blank">The Secret Social Network: AMA with Reddit&rsquo;s Erik Martin</a></strong></p>
<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>13. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/lean-email-marketing/">Minimum Viable Email: A New Approach Email Marketing</a></strong></p>
<p>Last but not least, take a look at a new way to approach email. We call it lean email marketing, after the now-famous lean startup model popularized by Eric Ries.</p>
<blockquote><p>The product must be both minimal &ndash; requiring the least effort to create &ndash; and viable &ndash; functional enough that users can provide useful feedback. Rather than spending time and money perfecting a product, the lean approach gives entrepreneurs the chance to get rapid feedback, fail fast and improve quickly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since marketers don&rsquo;t always have quick access to good designers, it&rsquo;s important to be able to cobble together your own visuals. Luckily, there are some resources that make this <em>really</em> easy. Ritika Puri offers up a list of killer resources in this post.</p>

<p>Good design is important for many reasons, especially conversions. The right colors and images can move readers through a funnel quickly. Bad design can mean lost leads and lost business. Payman Taei breaks it down in this awesome post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to optimizing your website for conversions, visual elements on your page play a huge role. By visual, I mean color, images, cues and their placement on your landing or checkout pages.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because creating compelling visuals isn&rsquo;t easy, it&rsquo;s important for marketers to find easy ways to turn their existing ideas and content into something more shareable and embeddable.

<p>How can marketers possibly balance personalization with privacy? Personalization, by its very nature, requires data that consumers are increasingly less willing to give. Unless, of course, they 1) trust the brand or 2) are adequately bribed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances. Cash, points and deals were the top reasons given for being willing to do so, according to the survey.

<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed. It&rsquo;s bad news for poorly run companies, as consumers are about twice as likely to share bad customer experiences.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Have you ever considered that your blog post or email is actually a performance? Think about it: Many people will see and read that post or email. Some will love it, and some might hate it. Still others might be bored by it. The results of your performance are measured in clicks, page views and shares. When you think about it like that, marketing starts to seem really intimidating.</p>

<blockquote><p>A digital-first operation requires a completely reorganized workflow. It means integrating digital teams with editors, allowing data and analytics to inform content decisions, and thinking about how content will look and read on mobile as much as desktop and in print.</p>
<p>Taking a look at its competitors, the authors note that it&rsquo;s this focus on &ldquo;the dry stuff &ndash; tools, workflow and process&rdquo; that has resulted in BuzzFeed&rsquo;s explosive growth.

<blockquote><p>Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email really from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends.

<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>

<html><body><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if your subscribers were hooked on your emails? If they opened and read your emails without thinking about it? What would that do for your open and click-through rates? And what would that do to your bottom line?</p>
<p>Yes, it would it be wonderful and according to Nir Eyal, author of <a href="http://www.hookmodel.com/">Hooked: How To Build Habit-Forming Products</a>, it&rsquo;s totally possible. <strong>The key, Eyal says, is to develop in your subscribers the habit of consuming your emails.</strong></p>
<p>Eyal defines a habit as &ldquo;things we do with little or no conscious thought.&rdquo; And he describes a four-phase process for developing a habit around your product, which in this case would be your marketing emails. Interestingly enough, <strong>Eyal calls email &ldquo;the mother of all habit-forming technology.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Checking emails has become a habit we do several times a day. Some people do it within a few minutes of waking up in the morning, before they even get out of bed. Think about your own relationship with email. Are there marketing emails you actually look forward to receiving? Are there particular people or companies whose emails you read &mdash; no matter what the subject line?</p>
<p>If so, then you&rsquo;ve probably made a habit of reading their emails.</p>
<p>Below, we&rsquo;ll look at why emails are habit-forming, and how you can get your subscribers hooked on your emails.</p>
<p><span id="more-3399"></span></p>
<h2>The 4 Phases of Emails That &ldquo;Hook&rdquo; Readers</h2>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="338" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FDtycnZgCfY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>1. Trigger</h3>
<p>The habit-creation process begins with a trigger. This is anything that sets a behavior in motion. Triggers can be external, such as a new email notification banner or ping.</p>
<p>The trigger could be internal, like feeling bored or wanting to feel important by seeing a long list of new emails in your inbox.</p>
<p>Emails provide both external and internal triggers. Seeing your name and email subject line in your subscriber&rsquo;s inbox are external triggers. Your subscriber&rsquo;s motivations for reading your emails &acirc;&#128;&#148; whether it&rsquo;s boredom, curiosity, or some other driver &acirc;&#128;&#148; are internal triggers. <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/04/billion-dollar-mind-trick.html" target="_blank">Eyal explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a product is able to become tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a pre-existing habit, it creates an &acirc;&#128;&#156;internal trigger.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Unlike external triggers, which are sensory stimuli, like a phone ringing or an ad online telling us to &acirc;&#128;&#156;click here now!,&acirc;&#128;&#157; you can&rsquo;t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. Internal triggers manifest automatically in the mind and creating them is the brass ring of consumer technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your job is to discover what motivates your subscribers to read your emails. What are their internal triggers? Use those purposefully to write even <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/winning-email-subject-lines-and-examples/">more effective subject lines</a> (external trigger) that connect with your readers&rsquo; internal triggers as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Action</h3>
<p>The second phase of habit creation is &ldquo;action,&rdquo; or carrying out a specific behavior in expectation of a reward.</p>
<p>In the case of email marketing, you want your subscribers to perform a series of actions: open your email, read or scan through it, and click on a link. Maybe you want them to forward the email to friends as well.</p>
<p><strong>Consuming your emails will become a habit only if subscribers expect and get rewarded after performing each of these actions.</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3408" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/the-hooked-model/hooked-model-60-638/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?fit=638%2C493&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="638,493" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hooked-model-action" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?fit=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?fit=638%2C493&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3408" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg" alt="hooked-model-action" width="638" height="493" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?w=638&amp;ssl=1 638w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=129%2C100&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hooked-model-60-638.jpg?resize=75%2C58&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px"></p>
<p>So the next phase in creating a habit is&hellip;</p>
<h3>3. Variable Reward</h3>
<p>Eyal identifies three types of rewards: rewards of the tribe, the hunt, and the self.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the tribe</em> are those that make us &ldquo;feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One way to give subscribers rewards of the tribe is to give them a special name. This makes them feel like they&rsquo;re part of an exclusive club. They&rsquo;ll look forward to your emails and read them almost without thinking, because they&rsquo;re reminders that they belong somewhere.</p>
<p>Another reward of the tribe is to connect subscribers with different people in your company. For example, if your emails are always signed by your marketing director, why not send one from the CEO? Or another from an employee who has some interesting and useful content for your readers?</p>
<p>Behind-the-scenes access to your business and receiving information ahead of the general public are other examples of rewards of the tribe.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the hunt</em> are goods, products, services, information, or other resources we need to survive or to get through our daily lives.</p>
<p>Examples of rewards of the hunt are subscriber-only giveaways. For example, ship some cool swag to the first 50 subscribers who click on your link or reply to your email with their snail mail address.</p>
<p>Or occasionally give your subscribers ebooks, webinars, checklists, recordings, and other useful stuff for free. Make sure only subscribers have this privilege.</p>
<p><em>Rewards of the self</em> are feelings of competency, mastery, achievement, and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Subscribers get a reward of the self when they&rsquo;re able to empty their email inbox. Or are able to respond to every email that requires it.</p>
<p>You can reward subscribers with the same sense of accomplishment by grouping a series of emails into an e-course, for example. Then as you finish sending the series, tell your readers they&rsquo;ve just completed the e-course.</p>
<p>Take note this step is called <em>variable</em> rewards. If the rewards become predictable, they&rsquo;ll be less effective at creating habits. So change things up a bit. Give your readers something unexpected every so often.</p>
<p><strong>4. Investment</strong></p>
<p>The final phase in habit creation is investment. This refers to your subscribers investing something of themselves into your emails. According to Eyal, investments can take the form of time, data, effort, social capital, or money.</p>
<p>Investment is important in habit creation, because it gives subscribers a sense of ownership. The harder they work to consume your emails, the more they will value them.</p>
<p>Emails naturally require investment from your subscribers. In the first place, it requires effort for them to sign up for your emails and confirm their subscription (if you use double opt in). Then they need to invest time to actually read the emails.</p>
<p>But you could gradually ask for even more from your subscribers &mdash; <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve given them something valuable first, such as a series of really useful emails. Charging a subscription fee for an exclusive monthly newsletter or forum is one example. Another is requiring them to share a link on their Facebook or Twitter account to unlock additional content. Asking them to complete a brief survey is another type of investment.</p>
<p><strong>In other words, ask your subscribers to expend some effort in your emails. They will value your emails more as a result.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that these investments should initiate new triggers. For instance, subscribers who share your link in Facebook could then automatically receive a set of autoresponder emails relevant to them. Same thing with those who paid for your newsletter or responded to your survey.</p>
<p>Every action your subscribers take helps you deliver more targeted, more relevant content to them. This makes your emails more rewarding, which then increases the likelihood that your subscribers will get hooked on them.</p>
<p>By the way, Vero makes it easy for you to deliver content based on actions your subscribers make.</p>
<p>Carry out these four phases often enough, and you will create among your subscribers the habit of consuming your emails.</p>
<h2>Hooked: Not Just For Tech Products</h2>
<p>Eyal wrote &ldquo;Hooked&rdquo; to describe how using technology-based products, such as apps and social networks, become habits for users.</p>
<p>You can learn more from Eyal&rsquo;s slideshow below:</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="597" height="486" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/16424773" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="Hooked Model" href="https://www.slideshare.net/nireyal/hooked-model" target="_blank">Hooked Model</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nireyal" target="_blank">Nir Eyal</a></strong></div>
<p>I hope you now see that the Hook model is applicable to your email marketing as well. Many people are already addicted to checking their emails to begin with. Study the Hook Model and apply it to your email marketing. Help your subscribers develop the habit of consuming your emails, clicking on your links, and spreading the word about your content.</p>
<p>Knowing what you know now, what are you going to do to get your subscribers hooked on your emails?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>How would you like to write emails that hit it out of the ballpark each and every time?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll increase your chances of success if you follow a century-old formula that marketers and salespeople have been using since the 1900s. I learned it in university 20+ years ago, and it&rsquo;s still being taught and applied today. It&rsquo;s been used for various selling situations, from face-to-face sales presentations to printed sales letters, and now, social media.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how <em>good</em> it is.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;m going to show you what this formula is, and how to apply it when writing emails.</p>
<p><span id="more-2899"></span></p>
<h2>The AIDA Copywriting Formula</h2>
<p>AIDA stands for:</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>ttention</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>nterest</p>
<p><strong>D</strong>esire</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>ction</p>
<p>These words show the natural progression of an encounter with a prospect that would lead to a sale.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="402px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AIDA-email.png" alt="how to write persuasive emails" width="402" height="216"></p>
<p>In the case of email marketing, this is the progression from the time your subscribers see your email to the time they click on the link in your email:</p>
<h2>Attention</h2>
<p>Nothing will happen unless you first catch your subscribers&rsquo; attention.</p>
<p>Emails that don&rsquo;t catch attention are deleted without being read. Two parts of your email can catch your subscribers&rsquo; attention. The first is the sender&rsquo;s name. A generic sender, such as &ldquo;Info,&rdquo; &ldquo;Support&rdquo; or, worse, &ldquo;No Reply,&rdquo; won&rsquo;t get attention. The email may even be perceived as spam.</p>
<p>However, a friendly sender, such as <strong>a specific person&rsquo;s name</strong>, is more likely to get attention. Unless you are a household name and have an excellent reputation &acirc;&#128;&#148; like Amazon, Zappos or Apple &acirc;&#128;&#148; indicating a specific person as the sender is a good idea.</p>
<p>Another way to have an attention-getting sender name is to <strong>use special characters</strong>. For example:</p>
<p>~ Chris from Vero ~</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t go crazy with the special characters, though, or your email will look like it came from a tweener.</p>
<p>The other part of your email that should get the readers&rsquo; attention is, of course, the email subject line.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve discussed in detail in a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/winning-email-subject-lines-and-examples/">previous post</a>, effective subject lines:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Contain trigger words</strong> like &ldquo;free delivery,&rdquo; &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;news&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Personalize</strong> by using the recipients&rsquo; names</li>
<li>Are either <strong>very short or very long</strong></li>
<li><strong>Connect with the readers&rsquo;</strong> internal issues, or an external event</li>
</ul><p>However, this is not the only job of your subject line. Aside from grabbing attention, the subject line also needs to pique . . .</p>
<h2>Interest</h2>
<p>The second step in persuasive writing is &ldquo;interest.&rdquo; In a sales presentation, after getting the attention of the prospect, you need to get him or her to listen to you.</p>
<p>Similarly, in an email, it&rsquo;s not enough to get attention. Just because you have your subscribers&rsquo; attention doesn&rsquo;t mean they will actually read your email. You have to interest them enough to get them to open your email and read it.</p>
<p>In an email, this is the job of your subject line and the email&rsquo;s lead or first few paragraphs.</p>
<p>Here are three ways to generate interest in an email:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Talk about a problem</strong> your readers care about. Write about something that keeps them up at night, a problem they desperately want a solution for, and they&rsquo;ll be interested in what you have to say.</li>
<li><strong>Tell a story.</strong> Humans are hardwired to listen to stories. We&rsquo;re interested in what happens to other people, and we tend to identify with characters in stories. We may even have the same emotional responses. Stories are powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Make a big promise.</strong> Another way to make your readers look and read is to make a big, bold statement. Doing this makes them lean in and mentally ask, &ldquo;Really? How?&rdquo; Of course, your promise needs to be big enough to be interesting but believable enough to be taken seriously.</li>
</ul><h2>Desire</h2>
<p>Now your subscribers are reading your email. Your next task is to build a burning desire for your offer, whether it&rsquo;s free information or a product for sale. Without this desire, your readers will discontinue reading, or read without clicking, and then delete or ignore your email.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to fight apathy. Your readers may recognize a problem and want a solution for it, but not enough to actually do something about it. They&rsquo;re too lazy or busy or preoccupied.</p>
<p>So in the main body of your email, you have to make your readers want your offer badly enough to overcome those obstacles.</p>
<p>How do you do this? You have several options:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Show the features <em>and</em> the benefits.</strong> Did you know that people make buying decisions based on emotion but need to rationalize those decisions with facts? So give your reader emotion and facts to make them feel good about wanting your offer.Give them the facts &acirc;&#128;&#148; the objective, observable characteristics of your offer.But arouse their emotions by going beyond features and pointing out the benefits. These refer to changes in your readers&rsquo; condition that occur as a result of consuming your offer. For example, a free report may give them the information to do something with confidence, earn the admiration of their colleagues and feel smart.The best way to identify the benefit of a feature or a set of features is to ask, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; So you have a free report about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">email best practices</a> &ndash; so what? Keep asking until you&rsquo;ve uncovered the deepest results your readers want.</li>
<li><strong>Prove it.</strong> If you made a big, bold promise or statement, then you have to prove it. Before-and-after photos are powerful proof elements. You can also cite specific results from customers or promise to show a video demonstration. You could also paint a vivid picture of life with your product to whet your readers&rsquo; appetite.</li>
<li><strong>Use social proof.</strong> No matter how independent-minded we think we are, we all tend to do what others are doing. This is called &ldquo;social proof.&rdquo; An example of social proof is telling readers that 13,489 people have already downloaded your free report. Testimonials are another form of social proof. Make sure the individuals giving the testimonials are as similar to your readers as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Make it scarce.</strong> The fear of missing out on something increases our desire for it. On the other hand, when something is plentiful and readily available, we tend to take it for granted. This is the basis for using scarcity in sales and marketing. To add scarcity to your offer, make it available for a limited time only. Or, if it&rsquo;s for a physical product, say that the number of items is limited. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t manufacture scarcity. Always tell the truth.</li>
</ul><p>Now your reader rabidly wants your offer. Your job isn&rsquo;t done. Many readers get to this point and then delete the email. Don&rsquo;t let this happen with your readers!</p>
<h2>Action</h2>
<p>The copywriting formula culminates with you telling your readers what to do next. This step is also known as the &ldquo;call to action,&rdquo; or CTA. In an email, your call to action can be in the form of words, a button, or both.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of your email is to get the click, so tell your readers to do just that: Tell them to click! Don&rsquo;t assume they know this or will figure it out. Spell it out for them.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">this post explains</a>, there are four research-backed ways to make effective email CTAs:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Lower the cost</strong> of clicking. Make a high-value offer while keeping the cost of clicking to a minimum.</li>
<li>Place your <strong>call to action at the bottom of your email</strong>. The next best location is on the left side of the email.</li>
<li>Use <strong>arrows and graphic elements</strong> to emphasize your call-to-action button.</li>
<li>Consider putting <strong>multiple CTAs</strong> throughout your email. The P.S. of your email, for example, is another good place to have your CTA.</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s important to think of the formula as a series of steps, because if you try to circumvent the process, you will most likely fail.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you gently lead your readers along, step by step, you&rsquo;ll be more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Next time you sit down to write an email, think &ldquo;AIDA.&rdquo; Soon, it will become second nature, and your emails will be more persuasive.</p>

<html><body><p>As marketers, we spend a lot of time reading about how to improve our marketing, chatting with others in the community and observing how the best execute their strategies. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the sea of marketing information and actually forget that we should <em>always</em> be thinking about our customers. Always, always, always!</p>
<p>The articles in today&rsquo;s Whitelist address this from different perspectives. A higher open rate, for example, means you are sending better emails. A fast growing list means you are delivering value. Those are customer-centric strategies that can help grow your business.</p>
<p><span id="more-2888"></span></p>
<p>Are there any great articles we missed? Just let us know in the comments.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/06/05/high-email-open-rates/" target="_blank">3 Tactics You Can Implement Today for Higher Email Open Rates</a></strong></p>
<p>We love the Crazy Egg blog because the content is always in-depth and actionable. This post is no different. George Matthew dives deep into personalization and segmentation, two of our favorite topics.</p>
<blockquote><p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Personalization is much like a matchmaking exercise with the ultimate goal of pinpointing the best product or service from your catalog that best satisfies your customers&rsquo; needs,&acirc;&#128;&#157; says Scott Brave of Baynote in his whitepaper, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Human Need for Personalization: Psychology, Technology and Science.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>However, according to Scott, that doesn&rsquo;t mean every individual should be sent unique content. There are smart little ways by which you can send personalized emails with the touch of a few keys.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://marketingland.com/survey-showcases-consumer-privacy-paradox-trust-vs-bribes-86483" target="_blank">Trust Vs. Bribes And The Consumer Privacy Paradox</a></strong></p>
<p>How can marketers possibly balance personalization with privacy? Personalization, by its very nature, requires data that consumers are increasingly less willing to give. Unless, of course, they 1) trust the brand or 2) are adequately bribed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances. Cash, points and deals were the top reasons given for being willing to do so, according to the survey. Nonetheless a striking 42 percent said &acirc;&#128;&#156;nothing would motivate me to share personal information with companies.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/email-list-building" target="_blank">Email List-Building From the Experts: How to Grow a Massive Email List</a></strong></p>
<p>Buffer&rsquo;s new content crafter Kevan Lee continues to crush it. In this post, he looks at a few sites, including Help Scout and Andrew Chen&rsquo;s blog, to see how they go about collecting email addresses. The post is loaded with good tips and information, but as Kevan says, it all boils down to great content and calls to action.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/bufferblog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Copy-of-Untitled-design1.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/customer-centric-company/" target="_blank">Becoming a Customer Centric Company</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t directly related to email marketing but it&rsquo;s a good reminder that all of our businesses should be entirely focused on a great customer experience. Thanks to KISSMetrics&rsquo; Zach Bulygo for the reminder.</p>
<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed. It&rsquo;s bad news for poorly run companies, as consumers are about twice as likely to share bad customer experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/say-goodbye-to-comfortable/" target="_blank">Say Goodbye to Comfortable Content: How to Make Your Marketing Perform</a></strong></p>
<p>The only way to improve as a marketer, writer and human being is to continually step outside your comfort zone. This post looks at how marketers can make that happen, along with a few action items to maximize your &ldquo;performance.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Have you ever considered that your blog post or email is actually a performance? Think about it: Many people will see and read that post or email. Some will love it, and some might hate it. Still others might be bored by it. The results of your performance are measured in clicks, page views and shares. When you think about it like that, marketing starts to seem really intimidating.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get comfortable being uncomfortable.</p></blockquote>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em>&ldquo;Permission marketing is the privilege (not the right) of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to people who actually want to get them.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin</a></em></p>
<p>Email is an intimate form of communication. <strong>With great power</strong> &acirc;&#128;&#148; the privilege of inbox access &acirc;&#128;&#148; <strong>comes great responsibility</strong> &acirc;&#128;&#148; the requirement to respect recipients&rsquo; permission by keeping emails valuable, actionable and useful.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to follow a strict checklist before sending any email. Here are nine questions to ask yourself before you hit send.</p>
<p><span id="more-2784"></span></p>
<h2>1. Did I write a killer subject line?</h2>
<p>Your readers get <strong>a lot</strong> of email, so you need great subject lines to grab their attention. On top of that, you need subject lines that <strong>increase value without implying cost</strong>. In other words, you need to let readers know that the content of your email is incredibly useful and won&rsquo;t cost them a cent.</p>
<p>A subject line is your first call to action (CTA), so it must be free of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">friction words</a>. As Joanna Wiebe of Copyhackers explained at <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/authority-intensive-2014/">Authority Intensive</a>, calls to action are like unopened doors: The reason that people don&rsquo;t click is because they are afraid of what&rsquo;s on the other side.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of email you are sending, you want the subject line to make the value of clicking abundantly clear. Here are a few examples from the <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2014/01/29/email-subject-line-hacks/" target="_blank">Crazy Egg blog</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Where to drink beer right now</li>
<li>How I grew the KissMetrics Blog From 0 to 350,000 readers a month</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s get fat, Boston</li>
</ul><p>And here are a few great ones that ended up in my inbox recently:</p>
<ul><li>Let&rsquo;s get this party started: Activate your Moz account. [From Moz, obviously.]</li>
<li>This is not a mirage (but it will disappear soon). [Petco]</li>
<li>We got this one wrong. We&rsquo;ve adjusted all paid plans: Now add up to 15 blog feeds. [Buffer]</li>
</ul><p>Some studies indicate that subject lines should be short. And it&rsquo;s true that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">subject lines with between four and 15 characters</a> do extremely well. But it&rsquo;s also true that the best emails are really creative and speak directly to the reader. If that means you need a longer subject line, then go for it.</p>
<p>My weekly Quora update has some of my favorite subject lines. All of them are long, and all of them pique my interest.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Need subject line ideas? Take a page out of <a href="https://twitter.com/Quora">@Quora</a>&lsquo;s book <a href="http://t.co/FQXlWNUntv">pic.twitter.com/FQXlWNUntv</a></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Jimmy Daly (@jimmy_daly) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmy_daly/statuses/466328825371303936">May 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>Marketers should do their own testing to see what works for their audiences. Subject lines are crucial, so be sure you nail them.</p>
<h2>2. Who is this email really from?</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="300px">Every email provider allows its users to dictate who emails come from, but who is your email <em>really</em> from? Not only do you need to consider the person sending the email, but you also need to understand exactly what your users will see before they open your message. This includes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address and subject line, but it can also include the first text in the email, or even image alt text. If it could possibly show up in a user&rsquo;s inbox, it needs to be optimized. Here&rsquo;s a look at what I mean: <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Bouqs-email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Bouqs-email.png" alt="Bouqs email example" width="1054" height="40"></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Petco-Email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Petco-Email.png" alt="Petco email example" width="1052" height="41"></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tech-Hive-email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Tech-Hive-email.png" alt="TechHive email example" width="1057" height="35"></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email-marketing-checklist-mobile.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email-marketing-checklist-mobile.png" alt="mobile email examples" width="300" height="533"></a></p>
<p>To ensure that any available space is used to enticing copy, make sure that your entire email is ready for readers.</p>
<ul><li>Any and all images should contain alt text. Say, for example, you include an image of a cup of coffee. If it were a blog post, you might use some of your target keywords as alt text, but in an email, where SEO is irrelevant, you want to use copy that excites, scares or otherwise engages a reader. For instance, you might use alt text like &ldquo;Ready for a hot cup o&rsquo; joe on us?&rdquo; instead of image_coffee_300.jpg.</li>
<li>Another good reason to personalize emails is that it often shows up in the inbox.</li>
</ul><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Copyblogger-email.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Copyblogger-email.png" alt="Copyblogger email example" width="1057" height="39"></a></p>
<ul><li>Please don&rsquo;t start your email with &ldquo;Does this email look weird? Click here.&rdquo; You want to include accessibility options, but this text shows up in my inbox. This email looks great&hellip;</li>
</ul><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vimeo-email-example.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vimeo-email-example.png" alt="Vimeo Email Example" width="640" height="277"></a></p>
<p>&hellip;until you see it in my inbox.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Vimeo-subject-line.png" alt="Vimeo subject line"></p>
<h2>3. Who is this email really to?</h2>
<p>List segmentation is one of the biggest missed opportunities in email marketing. Because it&rsquo;s easy to collect lots of data about folks on our email lists, there is no excuse not to segment based on a number of demographics:</p>
<ul><li>Company size</li>
<li>Annual revenue</li>
<li>Current solution provider (i.e., your competitors)</li>
<li>Job function</li>
</ul><p>We love <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/increase-blog-subscribers/">Qualaroo</a> for simple data collection like this. With Vero&rsquo;s powerful email marketing software, you can send emails based not only on demographic data but also on behavior. For example, you can trigger emails when:</p>
<ul><li>A lead views a product page</li>
<li>A customer leaves items in his or her cart without checking out</li>
<li>A reader visits your blog three times</li>
</ul><p>There are so many ways to customize emails based on events that you can be sure you have a message for every possible user. Here are a few types of emails that should be segmented based on the recipient:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Consider versioning your newsletters for paying customers rather than for leads. Not everyone is in the same place in the buying cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Receipts:</strong> How big was the purchase? <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/">Include relevant calls to action in email receipts</a>, based on transaction history.</li>
<li><strong>Drip campaigns:</strong> Have automated campaigns ready for unique products and solutions as well as different buyer personas.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions:</strong> Your best customers probably don&rsquo;t need a coupon. Save it for the new leads and small customers, and offer your biggest spenders more value.</li>
</ul><h2>4. Is this email personal enough?</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="px">Blanket emails are rarely effective anymore. Then again, too much personalization can be annoying and even downright creepy. <strong>Data is a double-edged sword.</strong> There is a fine line between using personalization to get an email read and making people feel uncomfortable. At some point, personalization starts to have a negative effect. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/email-personalization-data-640.png" alt="How much data is too much?"> A good personalization rule of thumb is to only use data that you would also use in person, according to <a href="http://www.luxurydaily.com/personalization-means-walking-a-fine-line-between-helpful-and-intrusive/" target="_blank">Luxury Daily</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Jack Reynolds, executive director of e-commerce for North America at Clinique, said that it, too, tries not to cross the line by showing too much of what it knows about consumers, adding that the interactions should reflect what an in-store salesperson would say.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The more in-depth data can help craft the message and segment lists behind the scenes, but don&rsquo;t flaunt it.</p>
<h2>5. Is the copy perfect?</h2>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t all <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, <a href="http://okdork.com/blog/">Noah Kagan</a> or <a href="http://copyhackers.com/">Joanna Wiebe</a> &acirc;&#128;&#148; they are some of the best copywriters around &acirc;&#128;&#148; but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t write a great email. The copy doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but it has to be pretty dang good. Here are a few tips to keep your copy meaningful and effective:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Make every word count.</strong> My friend Tommy Walker over at <a href="http://conversionxl.com/blog/" target="_blank">ConversionXL</a> reminded me the other day that every word should lead the reader to the next word, and every sentence should lead the reader to the next sentence. Don&rsquo;t include sentences or words that simply take up space. Remember, it&rsquo;s harder to write short copy than long copy, so spend time trimming the fat.</li>
<li><strong>Write damn good sentences.</strong> I stole this from Demian Farnworth at Copyblogger, but it&rsquo;s so perfectly put that it must be shared. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt from his <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/damn-good-sentences/">post on writing great sentences</a> that everyone should read:<br><blockquote><p>
No sentence can be effective if it contains facts alone. It must also contain emotion, image, logic, and promise.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a great example: &acirc;&#128;&#156;Baby shoes: for sale, never worn.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Ernest Hemingway, and that little six-word story is possibly his best (his own estimation, not mine). Why? It&rsquo;s a story selling a pair of shoes &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; shoes with an intense emotional connotation.</p>
<p>See, your sentences don&rsquo;t have to say much &acirc;&#128;&#148; they just have to say the right things. Our imaginations will fill in the blanks.
</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Be yourself.</strong> Great writing relies entirely on authenticity, especially when it comes to writing copy that sells. Don&rsquo;t try to emulate Seth Godin; simply be yourself, infuse emotion into your copy and keep on practicing.</li>
</ul><h2>6. Does this email go beyond the written word?</h2>
<p>Most content creators spend their time writing words. That&rsquo;s often the foundation of a good content strategy, but there are so many other mediums you can use to grow an audience and convert leads. Podcasts, videos and even tweets are media elements that can easily be embedded in content, including emails. In 2013, just 25 percent of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/video-email-marketing/">marketers used video in their email marketing</a>, yet YouTube videos are 53 percent more effective than television ads. Buffer found that tweets with images increased clicks by 18 percent and retweets by 150 percent. The medium is different, but the idea is the same: Engaging visuals keep people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Take advantage of free stock photos.</strong> We use them all the time in our blog posts and then repurpose the same images for social media and email campaigns. Check out Buffer&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/free-image-sources-list">list of free image sources</a>, as well as Dustin Senos&rsquo; <a href="https://medium.com/design-ux/62ae4bcbe01b">list on Medium</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Embed videos often.</strong> Can&rsquo;t find videos that are relevant to your posts? It&rsquo;s time to make some. The easiest way to get started, especially for SaaS businesses, is to create tutorial videos using screencasting software. We are fans of <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get in on GIFs.</strong> Animated GIFs aren&rsquo;t right for every post, but they can be a fun way to make your content stand out. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/9-killer-email-marketing-mistakes/">See an example here</a>.) Check out <a href="http://giphy.com/">Giphy</a> for tons of free GIFs, and <a href="http://gifbrewery.com/">GIF Brewery</a> if you want to make your own.</li>
<li><strong>Keep an eye on influential Twitter users in your industry.</strong> A good tweet can be embedded in a post or email, giving credit to the original tweeter and link.<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>

<h2>7. Does this email include a call to action?</h2>
<p>Emails don&rsquo;t have to convert readers into customers right away; that&rsquo;s what landing pages are for. But emails can be used to drive traffic to landing pages as well as to blog posts, social media accounts, contests, webinars and any number of other things.</p>
<p>Remember that every email should ask recipients to <em>do</em> something. That thing might be as simple as asking readers to forward the email to a friend, or as big as encouraging them to register for a $2,000 conference. If the email is designed to be promotional, stay focused on one CTA so you don&rsquo;t confuse readers with multiple options. If the goal, for example, is getting them signed up for a free trial, stick to that, and resist the temptation to ask them to follow you on Twitter.</p>
<p>We covered this topic in depth in a recent blog post. In it, Lexi Rodrigo covers:</p>
<ul><li>How to convey value in your CTAs</li>
<li>Where to place CTAs for the best conversion</li>
<li>How to use buttons</li>
<li>How to avoid friction words</li>
</ul><p>Rather than repeating it, we recommend <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">reading Lexi&rsquo;s full article here</a>.</p>
<h2>8. Is this email responsive?</h2>
<p>Responsive emails ensure that your message can easily be read on both a 4-inch smartphone and a 27-inch desktop computer. Luckily, responsive HTML templates solve this problem &acirc;&#128;&#148; meaning you don&rsquo;t need to know a lick of code to create beautiful emails.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/54-email-marketing-resources/">massive list of email marketing resources</a>, we linked to a number of good resources for HTML emails.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/html-email-templates/" target="_blank">HTML emails</a> aren&rsquo;t <em>always</em> the right approach, but they will give your messages a beautiful look and feel. There are <em>so many</em> options to choose from. Here are our three favorite places for HTML email templates.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://themeforest.net/category/marketing/email-templates" target="_blank">ThemeForest</a>: There are more than 600 email designs here. They aren&rsquo;t free, but for between $6 and $20, you can purchase some beautiful designs. Nearly all of these are mobile responsive, but confirm before you buy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/templates/all/" target="_blank">Campaign Monitor</a>: With more than 100 free templates, this is a gold mine for email marketers. Browse through their designs, or <a href="http://i3.campaignmonitor.com/assets/files/templates/complete_package-updated.zip?_ga=1.163551612.1998660057.1395775364" target="_blank">download them all right now</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Mashable curated a handy list of <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/08/email-responsive-design/" target="_blank">free mobile-responsive templates</a>. If you have another good source of email templates, let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>Another option is to use plain text. HTML emails sometimes give off the wrong vibe &acirc;&#128;&#148; they feel promotional &acirc;&#128;&#148; while plain text emails feel very personal. They also have the advantage of being naturally responsive.</p>
<p>Noah Kagan uses this strategy to great effect:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/noah-kagan-email.png" alt="Noah Kagan Email Example"></p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with plain text and HTML. Just make sure that anyone can read your email on any device.</p>
<h2>9. Am I growth hacking?</h2>
<p>Always ask yourself this question. Always.</p>
<p>Why? Because small changes can have a massive impact on traffic, social sharing and conversion. At its roots, growth hacking is essentially thinking outside the box. Here are a few ways to start growth hacking your emails today:</p>
<ul><li>Link to your social media accounts in every email.</li>
<li>Make your transaction emails more interesting by offering upsells, deals and links to useful content.</li>
<li>Ask readers to refer customers in exchange for a discount.</li>
<li>Turn your receipts and billing notifications into <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/">sales tools</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/online-marketing-strategies-partnerships/">Partner with peers</a> to grow your email list faster and drive affiliate sales.</li>
<li>Clean your lists of inactive users. It keeps your spam score low and gives you better data.</li>

<html><body><p>First came search, then content marketing. And now, a compelling new marketing strategy has emerged: community building.</p>
<p>In the old days, SEO was considerably easier than it is today. A few links, some rich anchor text and next thing you know, you&rsquo;re getting tons of traffic from Google. Content marketing, which is essentially the process of making content that will rank and be shared, makes this process <em>a lot</em> harder. Your content has to be <em>really</em> good and <em>really</em> interesting in order for it to become a marketing tool.</p>

</ul></div>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-and-community-building/">Community building</a> takes content marketing to the next level. A good community is driven not by the marketing team, but by the users who come to participate in education and discussion. At Moz, one of the most well-known marketing tech companies of the last few years, the community is flourishing,<br>
thanks to a genuine desire to teach people about SEO and marketing, along with a bustling <a href="http://moz.com/community/q">forum</a>, <a href="http://moz.com/webinars">weekly webinars</a>, a 22,000-member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/SEOmoz-2976409?mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah&amp;gid=2976409">LinkedIn group</a>, a community blog and active social channels. Users can create a free account to access the community, leave comments, get more information about upcoming events and test out Moz software.</p>
<p>Someone has to manage all that activity. At Moz, one of those people is senior community manager Erica McGillivray. Her job includes social media, content creation, customer service, SEO, public relations, event planning and email marketing. We caught up with Erica to ask her a few questions about Moz&rsquo;s community efforts and email strategy.</p>
<p><span id="more-2752"></span></p>
<p><strong>How does Moz use email to keep users informed and engaged?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> We have a lot of the typical &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; emails to continue community and/or customer interactions on the site &mdash; such as notices when other users answer Q&amp;A forum questions, blog comments, customer on-boarding information, and routine reports on customer&rsquo;s metrics. We also have a monthly customer newsletter, messages about major product updates or events, and a highly-curated <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10">Top 10 list</a> of online marketing articles.</p>
<p>Our Moz Top 10 list is mostly non-Moz links and drives a ton of traffic to the great work our community that&rsquo;s not on Moz.com. We&rsquo;ve had people tell us their blog traffic has tripled, sites have gone down, people have gotten new clients, and people have gotten speaking gigs by being included. This spreads a huge amount of goodwill in our community and also keeps people very engaged with us, so when we send them other emails, they&rsquo;re more likely to open them.</p>
<p><strong>How does your experience in email marketing help you in your role at Moz?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> I never forget when we should have an email capture form somewhere (but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I always get my way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p><strong>Are there any emails strategies that you find to be extremely effective?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> The most effective emails are the ones that are relevant to your audience. I know that sounds simple, but if you don&rsquo;t know how to slice and dice your contact lists into correct groupings and make sure you have the proper permissions to email them, you are missing opportunities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/moz-email-open-rate-640.png" alt="Moz Email Open Rate" width="640" height="204"></p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m pretty focused on MozCon, our annual conference that&rsquo;s coming up in July, and we have a super targeted Events list that&rsquo;s slightly under 3,000 people. This is tiny compared to our Moz Top 10 list, which is 200,000+ people, but those on the Events list want to hear about MozCon.<strong> A recent email announcing the agenda had a 107 percent open rate</strong>, which means we had people coming back to the email multiple times and many bought tickets. (MozCon&rsquo;s $999 a ticket, so we&rsquo;d expect people to come back multiple times before buying and take time to consider the purchase.)</p>
<p><strong>How important is the inbox vs the social feed or SERP in 2014?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Even in the era of easy spam reporting and Gmail&rsquo;s promotional tab, email is still more personal. Done well, it has a more direct impact than social media or search. (And I say that as someone who&rsquo;s an SEO and social media manager.) But because it&rsquo;s so in your customer&rsquo;s face, it&rsquo;s easier to make people angry if it&rsquo;s not tailored to them. They can pick another search result or ignore a tweet, but they have to do something with your email. And you don&rsquo;t want that something to be the delete button.</p>
<p><strong>Email is personal. Why do so many businesses treat it like a broadcast system?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> It&rsquo;s hard for a lot of businesses to pivot. If you&rsquo;ve been sending blanket messages to your subscribers for years, it&rsquo;s hard to change. Especially if you&rsquo;re seeing some results. Never be afraid of changing or testing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any resources that you recommend to other marketers and community managers?</strong></p>
<p>I always recommend coming to <a href="http://moz.com/mozcon">MozCon</a>, which is Moz&rsquo;s annual conference, July 14-16th in Seattle. For community managers, <a href="http://www.cmxsummit.com/">CMX Summit</a> is also fabulous.</p>

<html><body><p>Does writing an email subject line make you sweat?</p>
<p>Knowing it can make or break your email campaign sure puts on the pressure, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to make it easier for you to write a winning email subject line. I&rsquo;m going to share research findings about high-converting email subject lines &mdash; the ones that get the email opened and read.</p>
<p>Researchers have tested at least four elements:</p>
<ul><li>The use specific words</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Length</li>
<li>Reader connection</li>
</ul><p>Read on to learn how email campaigns can be affected by these elements and how you can use them to get better results.</p>
<p><span id="more-2444"></span></p>
<h3 id="1.-use-words-that-trigger-email-opens-and-clicks.">1. Use words that trigger email opens and clicks.</h3>
<p>Words are the building blocks of your email subject lines. Single words can trigger images, emotions, attitudes and memories. Words are powerful.</p>
<p>Are some words more likely than others to get your subject lines opened?</p>
<p>Research suggests exactly that.</p>
<p>In 2013, <a href="http://www.adestra.com/resources/downloadable-reports/2013-subject-line-analysis-report/">Adestra</a> released a study of email subject lines from 2.2 billion emails in an attempt to identify specific words and phrases that get both higher open rates and higher click rates.</p>
<p>The study covered various sectors, including B2B, B2C, nonprofit, retail and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Across all sectors, the email subject lines with the following words and phrases had open and click rates that were higher than average:</p>
<ul><li>Free delivery</li>
<li>Sale</li>
<li>Alert</li>
<li>News</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Win</li>
<li>Daily</li>
<li>Weekly</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, benefit-oriented words like &ldquo;free delivery&rdquo; and &ldquo;sale&rdquo; do well in email subject lines. Words conveying urgency or time sensitivity also get emails opened. The success of &ldquo;video&rdquo; in email subject lines is probably due to the increasing popularity of online videos; more and more people are viewing them.</p>
<p>In contrast, some words in email subject lines tend to lower open and click rates:</p>
<ul><li>Free</li>
<li>Only</li>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Report</li>
<li>Today</li>
<li>Webinar</li>
<li>Monthly</li>
<li>Get</li>
<li>Register</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t miss</li>
<li>Re:</li>
<li>Fw:</li>
</ul><p>The low performance of these words suggests email users have gotten smart about identifying hype. Some of these words have become overused in spam, especially &ldquo;free,&rdquo; &ldquo;Re:&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that call-to-action words, such as &ldquo;get&rdquo; and &ldquo;register,&rdquo; generally did poorly in email subject lines.</p>
<p>Benefit-oriented words, provided they&rsquo;re not hype-y, do better in email subject lines than calls to action.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights of the study</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="479" height="3270" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/24648211" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="4 steps to writing a killer subject line" href="https://www.slideshare.net/adestra/ade-006-infographicsubjectlinereportv420130620" target="_blank">4 steps to writing a killer subject line</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adestra" target="_blank">Adestra Ltd.</a></strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Adestra study presents different findings for specific sectors, so it would be worth your while to get the full study to learn about sector-specific findings relevant to you.</p>
<p>In another study, words referring to movies and songs appear to lift email open rates.</p>
<p>In an analysis of 3.7 million emails, <a href="http://www.retentionscience.com/new-research-reveals-which-email-subject-lines-perform-best-for-marketers/">Retention Science</a> found that subject lines with a movie title or a song lyric have an average open rate of 26 percent compared with only 15.8 percent for subject lines without these cultural references.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s relevant, and when you think it will resonate with your readers, mentioning a movie or a song in your subject line will probably get your email opened.</p>
<h3 id="2.-personalize.">2. Personalize.</h3>
<p>In <em>&ldquo;How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People,&rdquo;</em> Dale Carnegie says &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does personalizing with the reader&rsquo;s name make email subject lines more effective?</p>
<p>Research says the answer is yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.retentionscience.com/new-research-reveals-which-email-subject-lines-perform-best-for-marketers/">Retention Science</a> analyzed 260 million emails and 540 campaigns and found that personalization did increase email open rates. Subject lines with the recipient&rsquo;s first name had an average open rate of 18.3 percent, while subject lines without a first name had an average open rate of 15.7 percent.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="http://www.mailermailer.com/resources/metrics/2013/personalization.rwp">MailerMailer</a> found personalized subject lines had an average open rate of 12.9 percent compared with 9.8 percent for subject lines without personalization.</p>
<p>Still not convinced? In yet another study, <a href="http://www.experian.com/marketing-services/email-market-study-2013.html">Experian</a> found personalized subject lines had 26 percent higher open rates than nonpersonalized ones. The lift was highest for travel companies.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, Experian found that 70 percent of brands do not personalize their emails. If your practices mirror those brands, personalization is an element you should definitely look at.</p>
<h3 id="3.-keep-the-subject-line-either-very-short----or-very-long.">3. Keep the subject line either very short &mdash; or very long.</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s look at the length of your subject line. Can it make a difference?</p>
<p>According to Retention Science, email subject lines with six to 10 words had the highest open rate (21 percent), followed by subject lines with five or fewer words (16 percent). Subject lines with more than 10 words performed worse as they got longer.</p>
<p>A number of other studies had similar results. For Return Path, the sweet spot was less than 49 characters (12.5 percent higher open rates and 75 percent higher click-through rates).</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.adestra.com/true-false-shorter-subject-lines-will-give-better-results/">Adestra</a>, however, the effect of email subject-line length on open and click rates wasn&rsquo;t as straightforward.</p>
<p>Adestra found that email subject lines had to be either very short (less than 30 characters) or very long (100 characters and longer) for open, click-through and click-to-open rates to be optimized.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/13341?token=IJGISsPwj_Eh4M2p4wljXrUaj5lWGYWcux4nHo07AbWtv_PwFDC0N44L0CzMofnF3yEofWsJZRZTpNhsyRSeANk"></p>
<p>While this finding may support longer email subject lines, keep in mind how many of your subscribers access emails on mobile devices. As we mentioned (<a href="http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/subject-line-strategie-that-increase-your-open-rates/">http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/subject-line-strategie-that-increase-your-open-rates/</a>), because mobile devices truncate email subject lines, you need to consider length and word order.</p>
<h3 id="4.-connect-with-your-reader.">4. Connect with your reader.</h3>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at general principles that work when writing subject lines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/email-optimization/subject-lines-that-convert.html">Marketing Experiments</a> studied over 100 successful email subject lines and concluded that they worked because they built an immediate connection with the readers.</p>
<p>You can create this immediate connection through one of two approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Connect to an internal issue</strong></p>
<p>By &ldquo;internal issue,&rdquo; Marketing Experiments is referring to a need or a problem your readers have.</p>
<p>Examples of internal issues include the following:</p>
<ul><li>Lack of resources, such as time, money or help</li>
<li>Unmet expectations, whether at work or in the family</li>
<li>Inability or inadequacy of skills</li>
<li>Operational difficulties, such as lack of usability</li>
<li>Fragmented perspectives, such as ignorance or misunderstanding</li>
</ul><p>When your subject line promises a relief or a solution to any of these issues, your email will get opened and get a higher click rate.</p>
<p>For instance, the following subject lines outperformed similar ones that didn&rsquo;t connect with an internal issue:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;[Company Name]: Now only 2-meal minimum order&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Free Unlimited Access to [Newspaper] Online&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Reach 120,000 Physicians Through Social Media&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Connect to an external event</strong></p>
<p>External events are activities, whether in the recent or distant past, which have occurred in your subscribers&rsquo; lives. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Action or behavior</li>
<li>Conversation</li>
<li>Single exchange (completed or abandoned order)</li>
<li>Cancellation (of a membership, contract or recurring transactio)</li>
<li>Service interaction</li>
</ul><p>Subject lines referring to such external events make the emails more meaningful to the recipient. These emails become part of a subscriber&rsquo;s &ldquo;story.&rdquo; As a result, the emails are opened more and get higher click rates as well.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of subject lines that connect to an external event:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;[Name], Your Account Information Is Ready to View&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Did you forget your [Bank Name] online username or password?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Subject lines that fail &ndash; Recent research reveals why your emails don&rsquo;t get opened&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>These subject lines work, because they connect with your readers&rsquo; lives. This shows the power of <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features">crafting targeted email campaigns</a> and subject lines based on subscribers&rsquo; actions.</p>
<p>Here are highlights from the study</p>

<p>These research findings give you a starting point for writing email subject lines that are most likely to work with your subscribers. Use the research to form hypotheses about the types of subject lines that may get higher opens and click rates.</p>
<p>These are not hard-and-fast rules.</p>
<p>Take into account that these studies were conducted in different sectors and markets, and even with different types of mailing lists &mdash; current customers, prospects, lapsed subscribers, etc.</p>
<p>The best way to discover what will work with your readers is to test. For inspiration, here are some examples of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-ab-split-test-tricks-so-good-youll-kick-yourself-youve-been-missing-out/">A/B split tests of email subject lines</a>.</p>
<p>And when you test, realize it&rsquo;s not enough to look at open rates; you must also look at click rates. You&rsquo;re not after hype-filled subject lines that get opened out of curiosity but are then quickly abandoned because they&rsquo;re irrelevant. Align subject lines with the content of the email to drive click-throughs.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with recent research on email subject lines, how do you plan to improve the subject lines you write? Which elements are you going to test in your campaigns?</p>

<html><body><p>Once upon a time, marketers could get away with broadcasting their products and services via advertisements, because viewers didn&rsquo;t have the option to skip through or filter out the ads. Consumers just had to suffer in silence.</p>

<p><span id="more-2208"></span></p>
<p>Today, any Tom, Dick and Harry can skip advertisements on YouTube; close the browser window if an article is too boring; and <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features">send promotional emails</a> directly to a dedicated inbox, thanks to Gmail tabs.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re living in a time where consumers have the upper hand: They have the unprecedented ability to pick and choose what they want to consume.</p>
<p>For email marketers, this means inboxes are getting harder and harder to reach. It&rsquo;s one thing if your readers don&rsquo;t even bother to open your emails &acirc;&#128;&#148; there&rsquo;s always a chance to win readers back. But it&rsquo;s a whole new ballgame when they take active measures to show their disdain for your emails by unsubscribing from your list altogether (forever). The message is crystal clear: Your emails don&rsquo;t deserve a spot in readers&rsquo; inboxes.</p>
<p>Access denied.</p>
<p><em>Ouch</em>.</p>
<p>How can you earn back your precious spot in their elusive inboxes? Let&rsquo;s examine the reasons why your readers would unsubscribe in the first place, and how you can remedy that.</p>
<h2>1. You send too many emails</h2>
<p>Have you ever subscribed to an email newsletter, only to be bombarded by emails for the next 7 days straight? Bet you didn&rsquo;t like that, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be alone in that sentiment. Research done by <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/sending-frequency-more-is-not-always-better/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> has shown that the more emails you send, the more engagement per campaign drops:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2211" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/the-elusive-inbox/too-many-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?fit=640%2C423&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,423" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="too-many-emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?fit=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?fit=640%2C423&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2211" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png" alt="too many emails" width="640" height="423" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?resize=151%2C100&amp;ssl=1 151w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?resize=50%2C33&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/too-many-emails.png?resize=75%2C50&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>A study done by <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/brand-and-subject-lines-fuel-email-opens-clutter-drives-users-away-21629/" target="_blank">Chadwick Martin Bailey</a> also supports this: 69 percent of the respondents cited &acirc;&#128;&#156;too many emails&acirc;&#128;&#157; as the No. 1 reason for unsubscribing from an email list.</p>
<p><strong>Remedy:</strong> Start small, and slowly increase the volume of emails sent while monitoring the drop-off rate. Instead of going all out and causing irreparable damage, pick segments of your list to test the waters,.</p>
<p>For example, using a small (but meaningful) sample, you could try increasing email send frequency from twice to thrice over a month to see whether it causes the opt-out rate to increase or decrease. HubSpot has an excellent five-step process to <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30302/The-5-Step-Test-to-Determine-Optimal-Email-Frequency.aspx" target="_blank">determine optimal email frequency</a> by adopting A/B testing.</p>
<h2>2. You send irrelevant emails</h2>
<p>On the other hand, your readers would be very glad to hear from you &acirc;&#128;&#148; except everything you send is completely irrelevant to their situation.</p>
<p>And guess what? Your readers aren&rsquo;t going to just sit back and take your irrelevant nonsense! A recent survey released by Janrain and Blue Research reveals that more than 9 in 10 respondents <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/consumers-dont-just-ignore-irrelevant-messaging-39254/" target="_blank">clearly dislike</a> these poorly targeted efforts and are decidedly proactive in showing their disdain: 94 percent of respondents take some form of negative action, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2212" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/screen-shot-2015-02-16-at-4-20-15-pm/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.20.15-PM.png?fit=196%2C209&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="196,209" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2015-02-16 at 4.20.15 PM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.20.15-PM.png?fit=196%2C209&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.20.15-PM.png?fit=196%2C209&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2212" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mistargeted-marketing.png" alt="mistargeted-marketing" width="640" height="352"></p>
<p>And, yes, 54 percent unsubscribe from those email lists. Yikes!</p>
<p><strong>Remedy:</strong> If you haven&rsquo;t already, it&rsquo;s time to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-increase-revenue-34-percent/">segment your email database</a> according to your prospective buyer personas or customer profiles (you do have those, right?).</p>
<p>Once done, make sure to send the most relevant content to each segment, and keep tweaking while you observe the opt-out rate in order to determine which type of content keeps customers around and which drives them away.</p>
<h2>3.You emails aren&rsquo;t mobile-friendly</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">48 percent of emails are opened on mobile devices</a>? Here&rsquo;s another fun fact: 79 percent of smartphone owners use their phones for reading email, a higher percentage than respondents who use their phones for making calls. Suffice it to say that, more and more, emails are opened on mobile devices rather than on desktops.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a large number of companies are still dropping the ball in the mobile world. In fact, just <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">11 percent of emails sent are mobile responsive</a> and 71 percent of the companies surveyed <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/62486-marketers-still-need-to-work-on-mobile-email-stats" target="_blank">here</a> having a nonexistent or basic strategy for optimizing email for mobile devices.</p>

<p>Now, what would you do if you received an email on your phone, and the message looked like the one below?</p>

<p><strong>Remedy:</strong> Make sure you optimize your emails for mobile devices. It isn&rsquo;t all that hard; this fantastic guide from <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketing-mobile-optimization-infographic.html" target="_blank">GetResponse</a> will help you optimize your emails in a matter of minutes:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2215" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/screen-shot-2015-02-16-at-4-56-15-pm/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.56.15-PM.png?fit=1041%2C328&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1041,328" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2015-02-16 at 4.56.15 PM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.56.15-PM.png?fit=300%2C95&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.56.15-PM.png?fit=1024%2C323&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2215" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mobile-email-infographic.png" alt="mobile-email-infographic" width="640" height="712"></p>
<p>Alternatively, responsive email templates will work just fine, too. Here&rsquo;s a list of <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/11/08/email-responsive-design/" target="_blank">32 responsive email templates</a> you could use.</p>
<h2>4. Your emails are just plain boring</h2>
<p>Throwing together some words and pictures to market your product or service just won&rsquo;t cut it. Your readers subscribed to your newsletter because they wanted to get something out of them, but a steady stream of pitches probably wasn&rsquo;t one of those things.</p>
<p>Consumers nowadays are just not convinced that they are getting the value they want in exchange for their email addresses. A study released by <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/consumers-dont-just-ignore-irrelevant-messaging-39254/" target="_blank">Forbes Insights and Turn</a> found that a mere 2 percent of B2C customers said they believe they benefit more than companies when sharing their data.</p>
<p><strong>Remedy:</strong> Ensure that any content delivered to your readers&rsquo; inboxes is high quality, and nothing short of it. In addition, whatever you promised your readers when you got them to sign up must be delivered, whether it be tips and tricks or exclusive offers.</p>
<p>This email newsletter from RunKeeper is a great example of following through on a promise to deliver &acirc;&#128;&#156;tips and inspiration&acirc;&#128;&#157; &acirc;&#128;&#148; and it&rsquo;s beautiful to boot:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="2216" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/screen-shot-2015-02-16-at-4-59-11-pm/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.59.11-PM.png?fit=1208%2C421&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1208,421" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Screen Shot 2015-02-16 at 4.59.11 PM" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.59.11-PM.png?fit=300%2C105&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-16-at-4.59.11-PM.png?fit=1024%2C357&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2216" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/runkeeper-email.png" alt="runkeeper-email" width="640" height="654"></p>
<p>It is becoming harder and harder to excel at email marketing, especially with bigwigs such as Google working to keep the quality of emails as high as possible for their users. That alone isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing; it keeps marketers on their toes and has forced them to up their games accordingly.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, reaching the elusive inbox isn&rsquo;t elusive at all &acirc;&#128;&#148; it just takes hard and honest work.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Blogging and content marketing has been one of the hottest trends over the past few years.</p>
<p>Online businesses figured out that by<strong> producing amazing content</strong> that provides value to their customer base they can increase traffic, educate and built trust: <strong>generating more leads and sales</strong>.</p>
<p>In this way, content ends up being a win-win for everyone: businesses get more people to their website and prospective customers get highly valuable information that helps them be more efficient and do their job better.</p>
<p>So, naturally, lots of businesses have bought into this strategy as a cost effective way to generate traffic, leads, and sales.</p>
<p>But not everyone has bought in: many businesses wonder if it&rsquo;s too much work and others aren&rsquo;t sure whether or not it really works.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re game to say that<strong> it does work</strong> and that we&rsquo;ve gotten amazing results thanks our content marketing here at Vero.</p>
<p>In order to back that up, we&rsquo;ll walk through <strong>three compelling reasons every business should consider starting a blog</strong> and discuss whether a blog is right for your business, or not.</p>
<p><span id="more-1772"></span></p>
<h2>Reason #1: Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
<p>In order to rank better in search engines you need more content. You need more pages on your site that can rank in Google and the handful of other search engines that will drive meaningful volumes of visitors to your site.</p>
<p><em>Fortunately</em>, one of the easiest way to get more quality pages is to publish content as blog posts.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: if you were to try add new pages to your site marketing site you&rsquo;d need to dream up and design fully-fledged, varying pages in order to do well. That ends up being a lot of work. It takes a lot of time and <strong>isn&rsquo;t replicable</strong>.</p>
<p>On the other hand writing a new blog post is a process that can be streamlined without losing meaning. Sure, your posts won&rsquo;t write themselves, but you can setup all the moving parts so that you just need to focus on finding a topic, writing thoroughly for a few hours and grabbing a couple of relevant screenshots. Once you&rsquo;ve got this nailed then, voila, you can <strong>relatively quickly generate new pages with a solid 1,000 to 2,000 words that can now rank in Google</strong> for a certain set of keywords.</p>
<p>Not only will blogging help you generate more pages with more content on your site, but you&rsquo;ll naturally have more opportunities to build inbound links &ndash; another big part of search engine optimization.</p>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t want to just take our word for it, <a href="https://twitter.com/neilpatel">Neil Patel</a> recently published an infographic on his blog <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">QuickSprout</a> that showed that businesses that blog receive 97% more inbound links when compared with sites that only have static pages.</p>
<p>The infographic also shared that sites with a blog have 434% more indexed pages than sites without.</p>
<p><img alt="LinksPages" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LinksPages.jpg" width="791" height="456"></p>
<p><em>Source: &acirc;&#128;&#156;<a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/12/13/why-every-business-should-blog/">Why Every Business Should Blog</a>&acirc;&#128;&#157; from QuickSprout</em></p>
<p>How&rsquo;s your SEO been lately?</p>
<p>Have you been scratching your head about how to get more inbound links and how to create more content for your site?</p>
<p>The hard data doesn&rsquo;t lie: business blogging and search engine optimization are a match made in heaven.</p>
<h2>Reason #2: Thought Leadership</h2>
<p>Not only will blogging help you drive more traffic from search engines but it will also help to build your personal and business brands as a thought leader. Building a brand isn&rsquo;t just for the big guys. Jason Lemkin shares the power a <a href="http://saastr.com/2013/10/15/in-the-early-days-you-wont-have-enough-customers-but-the-mini-brand-will-come-to-the-rescue/">mini-brand</a> can have in the success or failure of an early stage company.</p>
<p>So, <strong>how does content marketing help you to build a brand</strong>?</p>
<p>Simple: as you write blog posts, you draw from and share your personal and business expertise in the subject matter related to your business. Since you spend more time than anyone else thinking about your problem and its solutions, being an expert in your industry is something that should come naturally. After all, you&rsquo;re reading, studying, and working in your industry every day!</p>
<p>Take <a href="http://moz.com/about/team/randfish">Rand Fishkin</a> as an example.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="514px"><img data-attachment-id="1776" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/why-your-business-should-write-a-blog/randtwitter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?fit=514%2C235&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="514,235" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="RandTwitter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?fit=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?fit=514%2C235&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" alt="RandTwitter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg" width="514" height="235" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?w=514&amp;ssl=1 514w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=300%2C137&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=219%2C100&amp;ssl=1 219w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=50%2C23&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RandTwitter.jpg?resize=75%2C34&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s co-founder of <a href="http://moz.com/">Moz</a> (formerly SEOMoz) and recently stepped down from his role as CEO to do even more marketing and brand ambassador work. So where does he fit into the content marketing equation?</p>
<p>Basically, Rand is one of the finest examples of thought leadership that there is.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been creating content on search marketing search engine optimization since the early 2000&rsquo;s and has been blogging and speaking on behalf of Moz the entire time. Thanks to his amazing content production he is now a well respected (if not legendary) expert in the search marketing field. His bio lists that he&rsquo;s spoken at Google, Facebook, and Microsoft and give presentations for the United Nations, Stanford University, Public Media, NPR, YCombinator, and Hackers &amp; Founders, in addition to co-founding <a href="http://inbound.org/">Inbound.org</a> with Dharmesh Shah.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a resume, but it hasn&rsquo;t just led to his individual success.</p>
<p>The fact that Rand is such a well-respected thought leader in his field means that <strong>people take Moz that much more seriously</strong>. If Rand Fishkin is involved, then Moz must know what they&rsquo;re doing when it comes to SEO. The personal thought leadership Rand has developed is passed along and share with his company and lends credibility to the entire organization.</p>
<p>Another example is Neil Patel, co-founder of Crazy Egg and KISSmetrics, two internet marketing analytics companies. He&rsquo;s an expert when it comes to internet marketing, which lends credibility to both of those businesses.</p>
<p>People think, <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;If Neil is involved in Crazy Egg and KISSmetrics, then they must be good at what they do because Neil really know his stuff.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p>Without blogging and without speaking, neither of these two thought leaders would hold the position they do. The reason Rand and Neil and hundreds of other founders are considered experts is because they write posts about their industry, which means they share their expertise and prove to people how much they know about their field.</p>
<p><strong>The same holds true for your business.</strong> If you&rsquo;re a personal finance company like <a href="https://www.mint.com/">Mint</a> and you have one of the top personal finance blogs in the industry, then use that platform show people that your company really knows what it&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
<p>Writing blog posts and demonstrating your business&rsquo;s expertise in a certain field goes a huge distance towards positioning your company (and founders) as a thought leader and builds credibility for your brand.</p>
<p>And just in case you don&rsquo;t want to take our word for it (again), here are some more stats for you:</p>
<ol><li>61% of consumers have made a purchase based on a blog post.</li>
<li>60% of consumers feel positive about a corporate brand after reading their blog.</li>
<li>82% of consumers enjoy reading relevant content from company blogs.</li>
<li>70% of consumers learn about a company through their blog rather than ads.</li>
</ol><p>When you combine all of these facets, business blogging is a great way to<strong> create a positive experience for your customers</strong> and to begin to influence them with your business&rsquo; expertise in its field.</p>
<h2>Reason #3: Leads and Sales</h2>
<p>Last but most <strong>definitely not</strong> least, the main reason your business should consider starting a blog in order to generate more leads and more sales.</p>
<p>As you write new posts that get read by your subscribers, shared via social media, and found through search engines, you&rsquo;ll generate more and more traffic. Combined with the power of SEO (as per point one) this traffic will build, slowly at first and exponentially later, constantly increasing the number of potential customers that come across your product and give your homepage a look.</p>
<p>This can only help sales go in one direction: <em>up</em>.</p>
<p>The great thing about content is that not all customers are ready to buy on the first visit. As you&rsquo;ll be blogging regularly you have lots of opportunity to talk with your potential customers and share all sorts of great ideas. After visiting your site 10, 20, or 30 times over the course of six months to a year, the time will be right for these potential customers to buy and your product will well and truly be in the running.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://getvero.com">Vero</a>, our most important blog statistics are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>We generate <strong>65% of our traffic</strong> via our blog,
</li>
<li>
<p>42% of trial signups read a blog post <strong>before signing up to Vero</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over 65% of all paying Vero subscribers read at least one blog post before paying.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>The majority of our other customers come via word of mouth, many of whom likely heard about us from blog readers. To be honest, if we didn&rsquo;t have a blog, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a clue how to grow our business in such a cost effective way or <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/startup-first-year-growth/">as quickly as we have</a>.</p>

<p>Managing a blog takes time and sometimes it takes money too (when we pay for writing or design work) but the dollar cost pales in comparison to the cost of running an AdWords campaign that would generate the same amount of traffic, leads, and sales for our site. Further more, no other channel would help us build thought leadership and long-lasting, lead-generating content like blogging does.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say we&rsquo;re big fans of business blogging since we&rsquo;ve seen such good results with our own blog here at Vero.</p>
<h2>Should <em>Every</em> Business Really Have a Blog?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to touch on the original premise of this post: that <em>every</em> business should have a blog.</p>
<p>Is that <em>really</em> true?</p>
<p>To be honest, saying it that way stretches the truth ever so slightly. There&rsquo;s a<strong> ton of benefit that comes from blogging</strong>, and yes, 99% of businesses can benefit from having a blog, but not every business should have one.</p>
<p>So how do you know if your business should or shouldn&rsquo;t? Here are some key indicators:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Do you or does someone else on your staff have the time to write multiple blog posts per month consistently?</strong> Consistency is key when it comes to business blogging. If you&rsquo;re not able to consistently produce high-quality content, then maybe you should consider whether or not a blog is right for your business. You should first evaluate the time commitment required and then make sure you&rsquo;re ready to commit to the work that successful business blogging takes. If you don&rsquo;t post consistently you&rsquo;ll just get bummed out and blame it on the content marketing. Consistency helps you stay focused, learn to improve your writing and look to the future. Just like any other marketing, contnet is about testing ideas, seeing what works and repeating.</li>
</ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Are you willing to hire freelance writers to produce content for your blog if you don&rsquo;t have the time?</strong> If you&rsquo;re not able to invest the time required to consistently produce content for your blog, then you may want to consider hiring a freelance writer. In case you do, make sure you look for qualified writers who are experts in your field and know how to write top-notch blog content. It&rsquo;s worthwhile to pay a little more ($150 to $200 per post) to hire someone that really knows what they&rsquo;re doing. This is a much harder road to start with: there is nothing like becoming your own content master but it is a viable path if you can work with truly dedicated writers.</li>
</ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Are you willing to invest the time it takes to become successful?</strong> Gaining traction with business blogging can easily take six months or more. Your site needs to build momentum, you have to develop relationships with other bloggers and you have to learn how to promote your posts. All of these points take time to learn and to pick up steam. If you&rsquo;re not willing to invest at least six months until you start seeing good results, then starting a blog might be something you want to put on hold until you&rsquo;re ready.</li>
</ol><p>Having said all that: if you put in the time and have the excitement to learn and improve your content marketing then business blogging is one of the most powerful ways you can drive traffic that converts to your website.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Should every business have a blog, or is business blogging, i.e. content marketing, a waste of time for a lot of businesses?</strong></p>
