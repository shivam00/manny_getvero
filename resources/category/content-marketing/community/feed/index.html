<html><body><p>When it comes time to survey your email subscribers, most marketers look to Google Forms or SurveyMonkey. These are useful tools but both have one major disadvantage: they require the user to leave the email, then take the survey.</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nicer if they could take simple surveys right in the email, regardless of their mail platform? After all, removing friction from the conversion process is one of the pillars of CRO.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way. We discovered a tool called <a href="http://www.clickinsights.io/">ClickInsights</a> on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/clickinsights">ProductHunt</a> recently that makes surveys easier than ever. Although it hasn&rsquo;t officially launched, we got early access and thought we&rsquo;d show you how it works.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> Do you get the Product Hunt newsletter? <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank">Sign up</a>, it&rsquo;s pure gold.</em></p>
<h2>How to Get Meaningful Data from Surveys</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20144?token=TQ0j4OFK0qc5j-LOYDAyT6Jeb-svRrlpd14TAliIhlV3UsBulHzySR3nr4wpEpaAr8H-WUHQUqj0SUQDvdi4EEQ" alt="results.jpg"></p>
<p>When it comes to surveys, simple is key. If you create too many steps or ask for too much of your users&rsquo; time, they are going to ignore you (and who could blame them?).</p>
<p>Step #1 for creating a successful survey is defining <em>exactly</em> what you hope to get out of it. So instead of asking someone, &ldquo;Will you answer 10 questions about your experience with our company?&rdquo;, consider asking, &ldquo;Are you likely to recommend this product to a friend?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The difference is that you will get more feedback and more specific data. You can also follow up individually with people who said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>Creating Surveys with ClickInsights</h2>
<p>One of the best parts of ClickInsights is that there are no distractions. The interface is clean and simple. To get started, just click &ldquo;Create a Survey&rdquo;.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20145?token=_jZYbG5VwsNTEkZSWboZrYp4EopjvHY81bMy6Qv4J_R6d1tljK2BKIMhAl7IRo45aK6GZFjYuHCUYvwfoOsj28M" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.04.57.png"></p>
<p>You get one question, so make it a good one. (You could, however, easily create multiple questions and include them in the same email. The only problem with this is that when the user clicks a link, they leave their mail client.) All questions are multiple choice and you can choose whether or not you will allow people to comment after clicking.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20147?token=aQLEaN36JmYWE17TwNzj0ihNDKNUcfM_creDaPR-tV0CNbhJF_1cCmueeSncBUp3-gQsuIutj5rsSBq51-J9PBg" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.09.40.png"></p>
<p>There is an option to integrate the data with your email service provider. (Vero will be a launch partner!)</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20148?token=-eht_dSEVULfmeJblNBRghhm7VJhI3H9pV4yBlFfGfd3QrfmQhDIiilrIvUBUIjCI8c3HTkVl7jf9a8N4ch2cUg" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.12.47.png"></p>
<p>The last option is creating the &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; message.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20149?token=D658sBBUV9joBPdNV2GvSbWTDbMLJ3tP6EahYx7P-_P2mnJS63DDdbac4VSIhVX-OJyE3U5Z87gNLXWsghAXQ_0" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.14.18.png"></p>
<p>After that, just create the form and paste the HTML code into your email. Users will be able to click the appropriate answer and ClickInsights will collect the data.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/20150?token=JmA1WhVdQ9hn-jdeVCK_vDM1SFPMTzQrmoWiGQF9yky22vshLyEQcb_J6WpveIJ2X30FYGb36iUQvqHQ37M0WiA" alt="Screenshot 2014-08-28 14.16.50.png"></p>
<p>Vero users can even create and track events based on the survey answers. This will allow you to send follow-up emails automatically. You can even embed the surveys into blog posts, which I&rsquo;ve done here:</p>
<h3>Would you recommend our blog to a friend?</h3>
<h4><a href="http://app.clickinsights.io/thank-you/53ff9bfb124a8dff698b456fo0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.first_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.last_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.email%7D%7Do0attrs0o_*1o0attrs0ofirst/">Yes</a></h4>
<h4><a href="http://app.clickinsights.io/thank-you/53ff9bfb124a8dff698b456fo0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.first_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.last_name%7D%7Do0attrs0o%7B%7Buser.email%7D%7Do0attrs0o_*1o0attrs0osecond/">No</a></h4>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! Pretty awesome, right? You <a href="http://clickinsights.io/">request access to the beta</a> here. (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/tony_hill" target="_blank">Tony Hill</a> for the early access!)</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><h3><em>&ldquo;AMAs generate some of the most compelling stories on the web, or in any medium.&rdquo;</em></h3>
<p>That&rsquo;s Alexis Madrigal writing about the beauty and power of AMAs on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em></a>. Short for &ldquo;ask me anything&rdquo;, AMAs have evolved from a fun distraction on message boards to serious promotional opportunities for celebrities and politicians. In the marketing world, AMAs serve an especially meaningful purpose. They give entrepreneurs, founders and the entire startup community a platform to share ideas and, perhaps more importantly, lessons learned from mistakes early in their careers. AMAs consistently contain info, tips, suggestions and lessons that are <strong>pure gold</strong>. You&rsquo;ll never get this information in a blog post or webinar &hellip; it&rsquo;s a benefit unique to the AMA format.</p>
<p><span id="more-4167"></span></p>
<p>In case you aren&rsquo;t familiar with AMAs, here&rsquo;s a primer on how they work. A forum &ndash; often Reddit but more communities are doing this now &ndash; hosts a live Q&amp;A with an interesting person. The idea is that nothing is off limits and no judgment is passed.</p>
<p>Madrigal summed AMAs up perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the AMA, there is no journalist, no writer, no personal brand. No one makes a living asking questions of AMA participants. There&rsquo;s nothing to lose.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without further ado, here are five AMAs that are absolutely loaded with interesting information on marketing, startup life, business, growth hacking, CRO and so much more. Enjoy!</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/comments/1whjdf/howdy_reddit_im_rand_fishkin_cofounder_of_moz_ama" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin on /r/BigSEO</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>kac4509:</strong> Thanks for doing this Rand! I am still in my first year of SEO &amp; Content Marketing and think I have the general basics down. I want to take my knowledge to the next level but am having a hard time figuring out how to do that since I have been self-educating. My question is &ndash; What resources/tools/whatever did you use to learn about this industry and how do you still stay on top of it now?</p>
<p><strong>randfish:</strong> Back when I was learning, we didn&rsquo;t have nearly the resources available that we do today. A few things I really like for diving into SEO/inbound/content marketing:</p>
<p>A) <a href="https://www.distilled.net/u/" target="_blank">Distilled U</a> B) <a href="http://www.marketmotive.com/" target="_blank">Market Motive</a> C) Conferences, in particular I like <a href="https://www.distilled.net/events/" target="_blank">Searchlove</a> D) Moz stuff &ndash; <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" target="_blank">http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo</a> and <a href="http://moz.com/learn/seo" target="_blank">http://moz.com/learn/seo</a></p>
<p>How I stay on top of it now &ndash; I read (and skim) a lot! Social media helps &ndash; I can scroll through my Twitter and G+ feeds and by following a good set of folks, make sure I know what&rsquo;s going on. It also helps that I have to teach and give a lot of forward-looking presentations. That forces me to know a lot about the field even if it doesn&rsquo;t pertain specifically to Moz.</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="http://wistia.com/community/posts/9dl/ama-with-rand-fishkin" target="_blank">Rand&rsquo;s video AMA</a> on Wistia as well.</p>
<h2><a href="http://inbound.org/discussion/view/my-name-is-brian-clark-founder-ceo-of-copyblogger-media-ask-me-anything-or-whatever">Brian Clark on Inbound.org</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>@dohertyjf:</strong> Brian &ndash; Thanks for doing this! I&rsquo;m curious what your rule of thumb is for marketing emails? Short and sweet with call to action? Epic long emails with tons of information? Depends?</p>
<p><strong>@brianclark:</strong> The purpose of an email, in our practice, is to 1) get it opened, then 2) sell the click. We send people to pages for the bulk of the copy/content, so you&rsquo;re really just trying to get as many people to that page as possible. That&rsquo;s the purpose of the email.</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/comments/1y9qie/im_ross_hudgens_seo_and_founder_of_siege_media_ama/" target="_blank">Ross Hudgens on /r/BigSEO</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>EmperorClayburn:</strong></p>
<ol><li>What&rsquo;s the hardest part of content marketing?</li>
<li>How do you come up with the right content ideas?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the most important trait for starting and running a successful business?</li>
</ol><p><strong>rosshudgens:</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>The starting blocks. I think so much about the site design, CMS and etc are sometimes completely out of our control but we have to deal with it as content marketers. It&rsquo;s really frustrating and something we have to work around &ndash; while also leveraging other soft skills like persuasion to get the changes that are vital to a site done.</li>
<li>I lean on the experts. There are certain sites that have similarities to our clients &ndash; commercial, investing in content, somewhat similar verticals &ndash; that can be referred to as inspiration for our own ideas. The good thing about content marketing overkill is there&rsquo;s a TON of content to learn from, and most of the ideas can be ported to other areas with no loss in success.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure I know for sure, but to me, the answer is belief. I believe that what we are doing and capable of doing is right, we just have to execute on it. If we execute and work hard, I don&rsquo;t think we can fail. No matter how much stress you have, if you truly believe that (and are right &ndash; hopefully you&rsquo;re right too) &ndash; I think you&rsquo;re going to do well, and that belief will get you through the tough times of running a company.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1lq3ne/i_am_ryan_holiday_author_of_growth_hacker/" target="_blank">Ryan Holiday on /r/Startups</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>PLURFellow:</strong> I am glad to have you here, Ryan. Very interesting career and wish you the best.</p>
<p>My question is: If you were launching a startup/new product, what is the list of things you would do? How might you go outside the box?</p>
<p><strong>ryan_holiday:</strong> I&rsquo;d ask myself:<strong><br></strong></p>
<ul><li>Who are your ideal early adopters?</li>
<li>How can you make your platform particularly enticing to them right now?</li>
<li>Why is this service indispensable? Or do you make it indispensable to them?</li>
<li>Once they come on board, does the service provide/encourage/facilitate them inviting or bringing more users with them?</li>
<li>How willing and prepared are you to improve based on the feedback and behavior of these users?</li>
<li>What kind of crazy/cool thing can you do to get attention&ndash;something that, ideally, no one has ever done before?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://inbound.org/discussion/view/i-m-oli-gardner-co-founder-creative-director-at-unbounce-ask-me-anything" target="_blank">Oli Gardner on Inbound.org</a></h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>@hnshah:</strong> What&rsquo;s the most surprising CRO win that you&rsquo;ve seen? Highest improvement or something that you didn&rsquo;t expect to have such a big impact.</p>
<p><strong>@oligardner:</strong> Definitely the test we ran on our templates page: http://unbounce.com/landing-page-templates/. I asked a few questions with Qualaroo and found 3 overwhelmingly consistent questions.</p>
<ol><li>How much are the templates?</li>
<li>Where can I download them?</li>
<li>Can I use them with WordPress?</li>
</ol><p>None of these are the case (they&rsquo;re for use inside Unbounce).</p>
<p>Hypothesis: &ldquo;By introducing a demonstration of &lsquo;Context of Use&rsquo;, visitors will be more informed about how the templates can be used &gt;&gt; leading to more and better qualified signups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can see the diagram that&rsquo;s at the top of the page now.</p>
<p>The result was a 43% lift in new trial starts! Incredible.</p>
<p>I also noticed that people who touch that page convert better than those who don&rsquo;t.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>
<p><span id="more-3554"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/02/27-marketing-tips-thatll-woo-your-visitors-and-win-them-over/" target="_blank">27 Marketing Tips That&rsquo;ll Woo Your Visitors and Win Them Over</a></strong></p>
<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>

Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>

<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances.

<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed.

<blockquote><p>Friction words are words that describe things people <em>have</em> to do &ndash; not things people <em>want</em> to do. They cause cognitive friction. Web copy that converts is focused on what people <em>want</em> to do.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>32. <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64822-can-win-back-email-campaigns-help-reactivate-lapsed-customers">Can win-back email campaigns help reactivate lapsed customers?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tommy Walker from ConversionXL has a way of articulating complex growth strategies in a way that anyone can understand.

There are plenty of examples and action items &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; don&rsquo;t miss this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just so I&rsquo;m clear, when I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Email Onboarding&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not talking about newsletters or batch &amp; blast messaging that asks me to read your latest blog post.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is creating a narrative in the inbox that &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; seamlessly transitions me from &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; by acknowledging how I interact with the stuff you send me and adjusting itself accordingly, made possible by trigger &amp; behavioral based email rules.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>36. <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/your-next-email-subject-line/" target="_blank">4 Hacks You Should Know Before You Craft Your Next Email Subject Line</a></strong></p>
<p>We love hacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that we really liked Zach Bulygo&rsquo;s post on subject line hacks on the KISSmetrics blog. These tips are straightforward, simple and potentially very powerful. Keep this bookmarked for the next time you are struggling with a subject line.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no such thing as the perfect subject line. As a marketer, you need to test your subject lines and see which ones get the most opens. (Now, clearly, getting people to open your email is only one part. After that you need to get them to click or tap on something in the email.) But you&rsquo;ve won half the battle if you can get them to open the email.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>37. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html" target="_blank">What is spam?</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Godin, the father of permission marketing, offers a philosophical explanation of spam. In short, spam destroys trust. Read on to see how to earn trust and keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had never heard of the Weigel distribution but it&rsquo;s application to content marketing is spot on. Basically, the longer a visitor stays on your site, the less likely they are to leave. The principle is simple but getting those visitors interested in the first place isn&rsquo;t easy. Nate Munger breaks it down with plenty of examples and tips.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/how-long-stay.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>
<p>If you can keep them for 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re almost as likely to keep them for 2 minutes or more.</p></blockquote>

<html><body><p>The whole idea of community building is to create places where your prospective and current customers can congregate to chat with each other, offer advice, ask questions and advance their knowledge. <em>Any marketing benefit is indirect.</em></p>
<p><strong>This only works if the community is more valuable to its members than its sponsors.</strong></p>
<p>No community can be successful &acirc;&#128;&#148; i.e. contribute to the growth of its sponsors &acirc;&#128;&#148; unless it&rsquo;s a fun and interesting place to hang out. Some of the businesses listed below have created communities so valuable that people <em>actually pay just to be a member</em>. Others have utilized social media, old-school message boards and live events to grow their communities and, as a result, their businesses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely important to remember that a community is not a place to harvest leads. Rather, it&rsquo;s a place to share knowledge. The marketing benefit is so indirect, in fact, that it&rsquo;s difficult and discouraged to attempt to track conversions. If you aren&rsquo;t ready to invest in the good of the community, you aren&rsquo;t ready to invest in a community.</p>
<p><span id="more-3096"></span></p>
<p>Here are five communities that have taken on a life of their own.</p>
<p><em>For those of you wondering what this has to do with email marketing, remember that communities send a lot of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hack-transactional-emails/">transactional email</a>. Those emails have much higher open and click rates than promotional email. More transactional email for communities in a future post. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>

<p>Moz has reinvented itself in the post-SEO era. After dropping the &ldquo;SEO&rdquo; from the company name and expanding their software to include tools for social media and brand reach, Moz has doubled down on community. First and foremost is their blog, which features daily posts by folks from their community. In fact, anyone can contribute to the YouMoz blog and the best posts are moved to the main blog.</p>
<p>The entire Moz site is a social network of sorts. Anyone can create a free account and profile, join the forums and watch their webinars. Users get more value by registering as a member. It&rsquo;s an excellent way to encourage those users to eventually do a free trial of Moz&rsquo;s software but even if they never do, they can enjoy all the benefits of the community.</p>
<p>One other very cool thing that Moz has done is <a href="http://moz.com/community/mozpoints" target="_blank">gamify the community</a>. Users earn points by completing their profile, commenting on the blog and contributing posts to the YouMoz blog.</p>

<p>Earn enough points and you can actually get free stuff, including a free Pro account (these start at $99 per month). After 200 points, you can remove the &ldquo;nofollow&rdquo; tag from one of the URLs in your profile. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>Marketers are all-in on content but as Rand explains in the video below, it&rsquo;s not the only way. (He discusses community building at 4:45.)</p>

<p>Copyblogger is an interesting study on community marketing. For years, their blog has featured a collection of dedicated and passionate writers eager to share their knowledge with the Copyblogger audience. The comments section of their posts often featured intelligent analysis of content marketing trends and actionable tips that any blogger could benefit from. (<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/" target="_blank">Comments have since been turned off.</a>) Recently, however, Copyblogger has turned much of their focus to growing a vibrant membership-based community.</p>
<p>Communities don&rsquo;t require registration but for a fast-growing company like Copyblogger, this strategy makes a lot of sense. They use their membership site, <a href="http://my.copyblogger.com/" target="_blank">My Copyblogger</a>, to give registered users access to premium content like e-books. For a fee, users can get access to even more content, including webinars and a forum. It&rsquo;s not cheap ($248/year) and it&rsquo;s not even their main business (software products) but people are paying to be part of it. That&rsquo;s how good Copyblogger&rsquo;s content is.</p>

<p>The free membership is part of the marketing funnel that drives users to join the paid community (known as Authority), buy the products and attend <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/authority-intensive-2014/" target="_blank">live events</a>.</p>
<p>Copyblogger has accomplished something truly admirable here. How many customers of a corporation like Coca-Cola would pay money to join a branded community? My guess is exactly ZERO. Well done, Copyblogger.</p>
<p>For more on Copyblogger&rsquo;s philosophy, check out <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/give-and-grow-rich/" target="_blank">The Power of Focused Generosity</a>. Here&rsquo;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two kinds of people on the Internet: the greedy and the generous.</p>
<p>The greedy want you to pay for everything. Every link is an affiliate link. Every recommendation has a profit motive. The really good content is locked away until you fork over some money.</p>
<p>The generous want to give you everything free.</p>
<p>It never occurs to them that their time or expertise has value. They&rsquo;re kind, selfless, giving, and (too often) dirt poor.<br>
But there&rsquo;s a third kind of person on the Internet. And yes, they belong to the Third Tribe you&rsquo;ve been reading about.</p>
<p>This person understands that you can&rsquo;t be greedy and build a following. But you also can&rsquo;t just throw all your treasure to the wind. This is the person who understands the power of focused generosity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Running a community on your domain is a challenge and it&rsquo;s not the right approach for every company looking to get into community building. Inbound.org and GrowthHackers.com are examples of an entirely different approach. (I&rsquo;ve grouped them together because their functionality and sponsorship setups are very similar.)</p>
<p><a href="http://inbound.org/" target="_blank">Inbound.org</a>, a community for inbound marketers, is funded by <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank">Hubspot</a> while <a href="http://growthhackers.com/" target="_blank">GrowthHackers.com</a>, a community for data-minded marketers, is sponsored by <a href="https://qualaroo.com/" target="_blank">Qualaroo</a>. In each case, the sites are laid out like Reddit. Anyone can join, submit links and vote on other submissions. The idea is that the best and most interesting content is voted to the top. An algorithm keeps new content constantly moving up based on user interaction, and active discussions are the norm.</p>

<p>The reason that these communities are successful is because there is little to no sponsor influence. In each case, users have to navigate to the &ldquo;About&rdquo; section to find out who is paying for the software and the hosting needed to run the community. Each has a set of guidelines for users (<a href="http://inbound.org/guidelines" target="_blank">Inbound.org</a> and <a href="http://growthhackers.com/guidelines/" target="_blank">GrowthHackers.com</a>) that emphasizes the focus on creating value for the community and avoiding self-promotion. They both put the community first and reap the benefits as a marketing tool indirectly.</p>

<p>This is not the most obvious example of community building but it&rsquo;s exactly what Buffer is doing with their <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Open blog</a>. It&rsquo;s not a forum and it doesn&rsquo;t require any registration but it&rsquo;s got everyone talking about Buffer. Others startups have followed suit, creating a slow-but-steady transparency movement in the startup world.</p>
<p>Buffer&rsquo;s marketing is based entirely on culture. Founders Leo Wildrich and Joel Gascoigne are committed to 1) transparency 2) building a remote team and 3) interacting with customers. They&rsquo;ve built a culture which they can blog about, use as a tool for hiring new employees and connect them with other startups. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at their indirect marketing approach.</p>
<p>On the Buffer Open blog, the company publishes everything from employee salaries to revenue and blog metrics. Startup entrepreneurs could get lost in the wealth of information here.</p>

<p>Remember that Buffer makes money with its social media tools, not consulting with other startups. So why do they even bother spending valuable time and resources creating a realtime <a href="https://buffer.baremetrics.io/dashboard" target="_blank">revenue dashboard</a> and blogging about <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/" target="_blank">how much they pay their employees</a>?</p>
<p>Because people really care about this stuff. They come back to read every post, subscribe to the newsletter and blog about what they learned. They talk about Buffer on social media and interact directly with Buffer employees on Twitter and Google+. The connection is genuine. It&rsquo;s a community that&rsquo;s open to anyone and that provides great value to the right audience. Even though it&rsquo;s indirect, it drives a lot of traffic to Buffer&rsquo;s website and exposes a lot of people to their products.</p>
<p>As Rand Fishkin says in his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/randfish/the-content-marketing-manifesto" target="_blank">Content Marketing Manifesto</a>, the <strong>goal of content marketing is to build familiarity, likability and trust</strong>. Buffer&rsquo;s content is on-point with Rand&rsquo;s recommended relevance scale:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3110" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/marketing-communities/build-community-with-content/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="build-community-with-content" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3110" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png" alt="build-community-with-content" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?resize=133%2C100&amp;ssl=1 133w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/build-community-with-content.png?resize=75%2C56&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>A community based around content is extremely different than a forum or membership site but as Buffer is proving, it&rsquo;s extremely powerful.</p>
<h2>Now What?</h2>
<p>Ready to build a community of your own? Here are a few tips to help get you started.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Start small.</strong> You don&rsquo;t need to build a forum or create a gamified social network to start building a community. Start by engaging with people who leave comments on your site and respond to questions via Twitter and Facebook. Use social media to poll your followers about what types of content and topics they would like to see. In short, have conversations with people whenever you can. You&rsquo;ll learn a lot, draw attention to your business and lay the foundation of a bigger and more powerful community later on.</li>
<li><strong>Media, not marketing.</strong> I stole this from <a href="http://newrainmaker.com/audio/media-not-marketing/">Brian Clark</a> who uses the phrase to describe the philosophy of Copyblogger&rsquo;s new Rainmaker platform. It means that you should use the web to create your narrative. Your blog to tell stories, educate and share. It&rsquo;s not a place for marketing or selling. &ldquo;Media, not marketing&rdquo; means putting the community first.</li>
<li><strong>Be inclusive.</strong> Copyblogger can charge people to be part of their community because they have spent years creating content that people can&rsquo;t get enough of. Moz can require users to register to gain the full benefits of their community because they&rsquo;ve spent 10 years building some of the best marketing software in the world. You probably don&rsquo;t have those luxuries yet, so it&rsquo;s best to take the Buffer approach in the beginning. Build community in blog comments, social networks and webinars. Don&rsquo;t require registration at first. Allow people to peek inside, poke around and see if your content and growing community is valuable enough for them to invest their time in.</li>

<html><body><p>First came search, then content marketing. And now, a compelling new marketing strategy has emerged: community building.</p>
<p>In the old days, SEO was considerably easier than it is today. A few links, some rich anchor text and next thing you know, you&rsquo;re getting tons of traffic from Google. Content marketing, which is essentially the process of making content that will rank and be shared, makes this process <em>a lot</em> harder. Your content has to be <em>really</em> good and <em>really</em> interesting in order for it to become a marketing tool.</p>

</ul></div>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-and-community-building/">Community building</a> takes content marketing to the next level. A good community is driven not by the marketing team, but by the users who come to participate in education and discussion. At Moz, one of the most well-known marketing tech companies of the last few years, the community is flourishing,<br>
thanks to a genuine desire to teach people about SEO and marketing, along with a bustling <a href="http://moz.com/community/q">forum</a>, <a href="http://moz.com/webinars">weekly webinars</a>, a 22,000-member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/SEOmoz-2976409?mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah&amp;gid=2976409">LinkedIn group</a>, a community blog and active social channels. Users can create a free account to access the community, leave comments, get more information about upcoming events and test out Moz software.</p>
<p>Someone has to manage all that activity. At Moz, one of those people is senior community manager Erica McGillivray. Her job includes social media, content creation, customer service, SEO, public relations, event planning and email marketing. We caught up with Erica to ask her a few questions about Moz&rsquo;s community efforts and email strategy.</p>
<p><span id="more-2752"></span></p>
<p><strong>How does Moz use email to keep users informed and engaged?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> We have a lot of the typical &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; emails to continue community and/or customer interactions on the site &mdash; such as notices when other users answer Q&amp;A forum questions, blog comments, customer on-boarding information, and routine reports on customer&rsquo;s metrics. We also have a monthly customer newsletter, messages about major product updates or events, and a highly-curated <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10">Top 10 list</a> of online marketing articles.</p>
<p>Our Moz Top 10 list is mostly non-Moz links and drives a ton of traffic to the great work our community that&rsquo;s not on Moz.com. We&rsquo;ve had people tell us their blog traffic has tripled, sites have gone down, people have gotten new clients, and people have gotten speaking gigs by being included. This spreads a huge amount of goodwill in our community and also keeps people very engaged with us, so when we send them other emails, they&rsquo;re more likely to open them.</p>
<p><strong>How does your experience in email marketing help you in your role at Moz?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> I never forget when we should have an email capture form somewhere (but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I always get my way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p><strong>Are there any emails strategies that you find to be extremely effective?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> The most effective emails are the ones that are relevant to your audience. I know that sounds simple, but if you don&rsquo;t know how to slice and dice your contact lists into correct groupings and make sure you have the proper permissions to email them, you are missing opportunities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/moz-email-open-rate-640.png" alt="Moz Email Open Rate" width="640" height="204"></p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m pretty focused on MozCon, our annual conference that&rsquo;s coming up in July, and we have a super targeted Events list that&rsquo;s slightly under 3,000 people. This is tiny compared to our Moz Top 10 list, which is 200,000+ people, but those on the Events list want to hear about MozCon.<strong> A recent email announcing the agenda had a 107 percent open rate</strong>, which means we had people coming back to the email multiple times and many bought tickets. (MozCon&rsquo;s $999 a ticket, so we&rsquo;d expect people to come back multiple times before buying and take time to consider the purchase.)</p>
<p><strong>How important is the inbox vs the social feed or SERP in 2014?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Even in the era of easy spam reporting and Gmail&rsquo;s promotional tab, email is still more personal. Done well, it has a more direct impact than social media or search. (And I say that as someone who&rsquo;s an SEO and social media manager.) But because it&rsquo;s so in your customer&rsquo;s face, it&rsquo;s easier to make people angry if it&rsquo;s not tailored to them. They can pick another search result or ignore a tweet, but they have to do something with your email. And you don&rsquo;t want that something to be the delete button.</p>
<p><strong>Email is personal. Why do so many businesses treat it like a broadcast system?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> It&rsquo;s hard for a lot of businesses to pivot. If you&rsquo;ve been sending blanket messages to your subscribers for years, it&rsquo;s hard to change. Especially if you&rsquo;re seeing some results. Never be afraid of changing or testing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any resources that you recommend to other marketers and community managers?</strong></p>
<p>I always recommend coming to <a href="http://moz.com/mozcon">MozCon</a>, which is Moz&rsquo;s annual conference, July 14-16th in Seattle. For community managers, <a href="http://www.cmxsummit.com/">CMX Summit</a> is also fabulous.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how we described Buffer&rsquo;s content marketing success in our list of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/">must-read marketing blogs</a>. Buffer&rsquo;s explosive growth to more than 1 million users is due in large part to its strategic approach to content. They run two blogs &acirc;&#128;&#148; the popular <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Buffer blog</a> which covers productivity, life hacks, social media and marketing, and the <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Buffer Open blog</a>, which details the company&rsquo;s growth, values and even employee salaries.</p>

<p>Buffer recently hired a new Head of Content Marketing, <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/courtney-seiter-buffer-content-marketing/" target="_blank">Courtney Seiter</a>. When <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/about" target="_blank">Chris Hexton</a> and I saw this, we thought, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to pick her brain about content marketing?&rdquo; Luckily for us, Courtney agreed to chat about her new role, their approach to content and email marketing, and some of her favorite blogs and newsletters. Without further ado, meet Buffer&rsquo;s Head of Content Marketing, Courtney Seiter! <span id="more-2573"></span></p>
<p><strong>You are relatively new to Buffer &hellip; what were you doing before?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney: </strong>I&rsquo;ve been at Buffer since the beginning of February (2014) so just a few months now! Oh, gosh let&rsquo;s see &hellip; my pre-Buffer life has included a lot of different stuff. I was a freelance magazine writer in New York, a longtime newspaper reporter and editor and a SaaS community manager before coming to Buffer. Basically anything with words, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be in the middle of. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong>Buffer kills it with content. What is the secret to the success of the Buffer blog?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney: </strong>I feel so lucky to work with such a well respected and celebrated blog every day. Leo spills a lot of the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/5-key-lessons-we-learned-from-pivoting-our-blog" target="_blank">secrets of Buffer&rsquo;s success in this post</a>. The main one I focus on is the idea of <strong>&ldquo;Would anyone email this article to a friend?&rdquo;</strong> With that as our guiding principle, we try to make sure every piece we publish is thorough enough, unique enough and helpful enough to pass that test. Another thing I love about the Buffer blog is how much we, the content creators, are able to learn right along with our audience. We use a lot of studies and science to back up everything we write, and that&rsquo;s because the Buffer blog isn&rsquo;t really about entertaining you or offering up our own opinions about what you should do &ndash; it&rsquo;s about objectively experimenting and learning together.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen this deck referenced on the Buffer blog. It&rsquo;s from Moz, and it&rsquo;s pure gold.</em></p>

<p><strong>How do you and (Buffer Content Crafter) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevanlee" target="_blank">Kevan Lee</a> work together to tackle posts? Where do (co-founders) Leo and Joel fit in to the content strategy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney: </strong>It&rsquo;s a very communal, teamwork-oriented atmosphere at Buffer, which makes for a lovely and creative environment. This post <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/how-we-manage-a-blog-with-700000-readers-per-month" target="_blank">talks a good bit about our workflow</a>, but basically both Kevan and I &acirc;&#128;&#148; and really, anyone else at Buffer who wants to &acirc;&#128;&#148; contribute ideas to an ongoing Trello board as we think of them (which is sort of always!). Once a week, we&rsquo;ll go through the ideas and plan the week ahead. Once a month, Joel, Leo and I get together to talk high-level strategy and overall vision.</p>

<p><strong>How do you divide your time between writing, promoting and strategizing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney:</strong> That&rsquo;s a really great question, and honestly something I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out. At the point, Kevan is Buffer&rsquo;s main writer, and he&rsquo;s producing a ton of really amazing stuff. On any given day I&rsquo;m talking to folks on social media, editing future content, finding great gems for <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/the-story-behind-buffers-newish-content-suggestions/" target="_blank">Buffer&rsquo;s content suggestions</a>, working on educational resources like webinars (we&rsquo;ve got one coming up <a href="http://webinars.bufferapp.com/webinar-172/" target="_blank">April 30 with Twitter for Small Business</a>) and looking at overall strategy &ndash; while still dipping into writing as often as I can, because I really enjoy it.</p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script><br><strong>How do you use email to drive traffic and engage readers? Do you use drip campaigns to convert free users to paid users, or focus on only building traffic to the blog?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney:</strong> Supersmart question! Working at Buffer means you&rsquo;re pretty much always in the middle of an experiment, which is so much fun. We&rsquo;re always learning. A lot of our latest experiments rely on email as a way to get new customers more active in Buffer and remind dormant customers of what we have to offer. So we&rsquo;ll maybe take a particular post that has performed well on the blog and email it out to customers who haven&rsquo;t posted in a while as a useful reminder about Buffer. And we&rsquo;ll use email to give you great content suggestions when your Buffer queue is empty, so even if you&rsquo;re new to Buffer you can begin to see right away how easy it is to share great content and get a response from your friends and followers.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any resources (books, blogs, people, etc.) that you would recommend to the content community?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney:</strong> Definitely! Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-book-reading/" target="_blank">what we&rsquo;re reading lately</a> at Buffer. As for blogs/news sources, we read a lot of <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank">Zen Habits</a> at Buffer, I think <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em>&lsquo;s tech coverage</a> is great, and I adore the resurgence of unique, offbeat email newsletters like <a href="http://austinkleon.com/2013/12/22/my-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank">Austin Kleon&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings" target="_blank">Alexis Madrigal&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/" target="_blank">Barking Up The Wrong Tree</a> and <a href="http://nextdraft.com/" target="_blank">NextDraft</a>.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, I came across a post on the Moz blog about creating &ldquo;<a href="http://moz.com/blog/5-strategic-steps-to-big-content" target="_blank">big content</a>.&rdquo; It was witty, insightful and impressively thorough. By the time I reached the end of the article, I was hungry for more.</p>
<p>It turns out that the author, one Mackenzie Fogelson, is also the founder and CEO of a community and brand building company called <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/" target="_blank">Mack Web</a>. The implications of trust-based, relationship-focused, customer-centric community management for email marketers cannot be overstated. We knew Mackenzie could even teach email pros a thing or two about<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/the-elusive-inbox/"> earning their way into an inbox</a>, so we asked her to share her knowledge here on the Vero blog. Luckily, she agreed. We picked her brain about email, the nuts and bolts of community building and the future of marketing, and we learned a lot in the process.</p>

<h2>Are marketing and community building the same thing?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> I very much think of community building as marketing, but I may have a different approach to marketing than most people. To me, community building as marketing isn&rsquo;t a tactic. <strong>It&rsquo;s a lifestyle change.</strong></p>
<p>When you commit to your customers &ndash; which is required to build a vibrant community &ndash; your marketing becomes an exercise in awareness. You can&rsquo;t just tell the story of your company, products and services. You have to live and breathe your company values, all day, every day, online and offline. In other words, don&rsquo;t explain why you&rsquo;re different (and better) than your competitors &ndash; show it.</p>
<p>When you take the community building approach to marketing your business, the whole company undergoes a transformation, from the inside out. You start with your end goals in mind and work backwards to determine strategy, execution, and measurement. You collaboratively work with internal and external teams to integrate all of your communication channels: content, social media, search, email, and even offline efforts such as events and face-to-face exchanges. It&rsquo;s the integration of all of these channels that allows you to present a meaningful experience to those who interact with your brand &ndash; and community &ndash; no matter where they are.</p>
<p>Community building as marketing places the focus on relationships. You&rsquo;ve got to use both quantitative and qualitative data to guide your efforts, but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all about how you&rsquo;re connecting with people. It&rsquo;s important that you not only solicit feedback, but take it very seriously.</p>
<p>It can be hard to hear the truth from your customers and employees, but when you are brave enough to do something about it, people recognize the authenticity and transparency. Using community building as marketing is a powerful thing, but it requires a tireless commitment and genuine passion. It&rsquo;s certainly not for everyone.</p>
<h2>How has the marketing changed over the last few years?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> I definitely see an evolution happening with companies wanting more from their marketing. Companies who are seeking to communicate the meaning and purpose in what they do on a different level. They want to connect with their customers and they know that this isn&rsquo;t done by broadcasting a self-promotional message. It&rsquo;s those companies who want to contribute to the lives of their customers, and live their values and mission, who are the best fit for using community building in their marketing as they are up for the challenge of transforming their businesses.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing more and more of these companies come forward and it&rsquo;s really exciting to see the momentum for this type of marketing build.</p>
<h2>You do this for clients, but how does Mack Web build and maintain relationships for itself?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> Communication is key. But staying connected to people is a lot of work, especially when you&rsquo;re not a &acirc;&#128;&#156;local&acirc;&#128;&#157; company. Only one of our clients is here in Fort Collins, so the distance can sometimes cause gaps not only in communication but in the strength of the relationship. So it&rsquo;s something that we work very hard at and inherently build into everything we do (it&rsquo;s also a big part of what I love to do here at Mack Web).</p>
<p>For as much time as we spend online, we make an effort to match it offline. I love the face-to-face so I travel several times a year to speak at conferences and meet with our clients. When we cannot be face-to-face, we meet with our clients on Google+ hangouts instead of conference calls. It helps to close the distance gap, keep things more personal, and get more done.</p>
<p>There is a lot of overlap in communication and marketing. This is where community management really gets fun. We use content a great deal to maintain relationships with current and future customers. I blog often because I love to teach and share knowledge. It allows me to do that and stay connected to all the different communities in our industry.</p>
<p>We are very committed to our own blog as well. Even with a small team, we are creating a useful resource for our community of readers each week. We just started producing <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/category/nuggets-of-knowledge/" target="_blank">Nuggets of Knowledge</a>, also known as the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NOKlist&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#NOKlist</a>. It&rsquo;s a list of curated resources by our team, for our readers. It&rsquo;s a great way for us to connect by sharing other people&rsquo;s knowledge and it also gives our readers a chance to get to know our team&rsquo;s prowess and personality.</p>
<p>We also use email marketing to keep in touch. We send an email each week to let readers know what&rsquo;s happening on the blog. And obviously we&rsquo;re on social media a lot, both individually (I love <a href="https://twitter.com/mackfogelson" target="_blank">Twitter</a>) but also as a company. But even though our company is small, we have a dedicated social media and community manager that is continuously looking for ways to reach out and connect online.</p>
<p>Even with all these amazing tools at our disposal, nothing beats having a coffee with someone. That&rsquo;s still my favorite.</p>
<h2>Where does email fit into the community building process at Mack Web?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> Email is such an important tool for us and for our clients. Just as you must earn trust on social media to build your community, you&rsquo;ve got to do the same with email (and any other channel you use). If you can earn trust by offering your readers and customers great information, they&rsquo;ll look forward to your emails (and stay on your list). That&rsquo;s the approach we take and it&rsquo;s been extremely effective.</p>
<p>In addition to blog updates, we use email to keep our readers informed about the growth of the company and trends in the integrated marketing and community building space. We also have some drip campaigns coming up as an extension of our community building guide (more on that in a minute) which we&rsquo;re really excited about.</p>
<p>We find that it&rsquo;s really important to think of email marketing as a two-way conversation. Just because someone gives you their email address doesn&rsquo;t mean they want you to broadcast your sales pitches at them all the time. You have to remember that it&rsquo;s easy to lose the trust you&rsquo;ve spent so much time and effort building. Every email counts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great about email marketing is that we can use analytics as a barometer. We use A/B testing on our subject lines and are constantly analyzing the data to provide our readers with what they want. Similar to how we approach community building, we are sending emails to people, not email addresses, so we make a huge effort to provide information that&rsquo;s relevant and useful.</p>
<h2>What are a few great resources for marketers interested in community management?</h2>
<p><strong>Mackenzie:</strong> We recently published a 147-page e-book &ndash; <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/guide-to-building-online-communities/"><em>The Truly Monumental Guide to Building Online Communities</em></a> &ndash; which I&rsquo;d definitely recommend checking out. We did a webinar as a follow-up to this and made the <a href="http://mackwebsolutions.com/2014/01/essentials-of-community-building/">slides available here</a>.</p>
<p>There are several other books and resources that I&rsquo;d recommend:</p>
<ul><li>Carrie Melissa Jones always has great stuff to read about community on her blog: <a href="http://carriemelissa.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">carriemelissa.wordpress.com</a></li>
<li>The Moz blog always has great stuff on it. For community-specific stuff, you can <a href="http://moz.com/community/users/81197" target="_blank">check out Jen&rsquo;s posts here</a>. There&rsquo;s also a whole <a href="ttp://moz.com/community/users/233927" target="_blank">community building series</a> on Moz available within the posts I&rsquo;ve written there.</li>
<li>I think Wistia does an amazing job of building their community. I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/wistia">following them on Twitter</a> to observe how they connect with their community.</li>
<li>Marty Weintraub and Lauren Litwinka wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Social-Media-Community-Managers/dp/1118466853" target="_blank"><em>The Complete Social Media Community Manager&rsquo;s Guide</em></a>, which is a fantastic resource.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m reading a book right now that seems like it will have some great stuff in it. It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.brainsonfire.com/books/brainsonfire.html" target="_blank"><em>Brains on Fire</em></a>, and it&rsquo;s all about sustainability in your marketing (which is what we&rsquo;re all about).</li>
