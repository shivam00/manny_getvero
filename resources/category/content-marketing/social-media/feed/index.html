				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>The debates have raged on long enough.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/files/2012/08/email-vs-social-media-marketing.jpeg" target="_blank">94% of internet users</a> use email, while only 61% of them use social media. Social media marketing attracts fans to itself and engages in &lsquo;pull&rsquo; marketing with <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/11-shocking-new-social-media-statistics-in-america/" target="_blank">47% of Americans</a> saying that Facebook is their #1 influencer for purchases, while email marketing is all about &lsquo;push&rsquo; marketing &ndash; much less desirable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Email is so &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo;. Social media connects with the Millennials.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Social media is so frivolous and unaccountable. Email marketing gives measurable results.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-3969"></span></p>
<p>The truth is these conversations are missing the point entirely. As marketers, our choice of platforms does not depend on the one that is considered &lsquo;coolest&rsquo; or the one that is easiest to measure. The platforms we pick depend on which ones give the best results &ndash; both quantitatively and qualitatively &ndash; in growing brand value and adding to the company&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>If those are our yardsticks to measure a platform&rsquo;s performance, then both email and social media turn in some stellar performances. So looking at the issue in all fairness, the best approach today would be to strike a balanced symphony between email marketing and social media marketing instead of picking one over the other.</p>
<p>Here are ten ways to achieve that.</p>
<h2>1. Put social sharing buttons in your email</h2>
<p>An email without social media buttons is a salad without it&rsquo;s dressing. Social media buttons &ndash; whether they are &lsquo;Like&rsquo; buttons on individual items in your emails or &lsquo;Share&rsquo; buttons for the entire email itself &acirc;&#128;&#147; offer an added level of interaction between the users and your brand. It gives that much-needed zing to your email marketing that plain old text and image content falls short in.</p>
<p>An extra layer of connection between your brand and your email user serves to bring the user a tad bit closer to your brand in the long run. Besides, encouraging an existing user to follow your brand on social media is easier than getting a complete stranger to follow your brand on social media.</p>
<h2>2. Ask your followers to sign up for your emails</h2>
<p>Just as you encourage email recipients to share emails they like with their friends on social media or to follow your brand on social media using &lsquo;follow&rsquo; buttons in your emails; it makes perfect sense to cross leverage social media to benefit your email marketing efforts by encouraging sign ups.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://okdork.com/2013/05/16/how_to_get_more_subscribers/" target="_blank">Noah Kagan says on his blog</a>, multiple platforms is key to marketing success:</p>
<blockquote><p>People need multiple touch points to take an action. It&rsquo;s good to ask them to subscribe in multiple places (YouTube, Twitter, email, etc.). Don&rsquo;t assume your audience prefers only one point of contact.</p></blockquote>
<p>This tactic netted him 50 new subscribers the first day he used it.</p>
<h2>3. Share content from social sites in your emails</h2>
<p>Got a great review from a fan via social media? Talk about it in your email newsletters! Carried out an interesting poll on social media? Share the results via email too!</p>
<p>Amplifying social content to your email newsletters helps attract more people to follow you on social media. All the interactions that social media creates can add credibility to your email content.</p>
<h2>4. Tease your emails on social media</h2>
<p>Email allows brands to go in-depth on various topics &acirc;&#128;&#147; something that social media restricts you from doing. Let your fans and followers get a taste of the detailed analysis, research or insights that you share with your subscribers via your email newsletters by sharing snippets of your emails on social media.</p>
<h2>5. Maintain your brand across all platforms</h2>
<p>A critical aspect of syncing your email and social media marketing efforts is to maintain a common voice on both platforms. This is easier said than done, as generally these two functions are handled by separate teams.</p>
<p>It pays to make a conscious effort to get both teams on the same page. Use the same brand guidelines and personality on both platforms to avoid user disconnect.</p>
<h2>6. Share complimentary content</h2>
<p>A user that has subscribed to your social networks and your email newsletters does so in the hope of exponentially higher value from your end. However, when you copy-paste the same stuff on social media that you sent out in your last newsletter, you are essentially boring such customers and taking away their fundamental reason to follow you on both platforms.</p>
<p>Offer fresh content that is designed to work best on each medium, but keep in mind that these pieces of content need to be complementary and related to the same overall theme and tone of your marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2>7. Offer goodies to &lsquo;overlapping&rsquo; customers</h2>
<p>If you want double the love from your users, be prepared to offer the same back to them as well. Give your users tangible incentives (over and above great content) to follow you on social media and on email.</p>
<p>This could be in the form of a coupon, a free goodie like a branded t-shirt as a keepsake or even a valuable white paper on a topic that is relevant to them.</p>
<h2>8. Conduct contests and surveys on both</h2>
<p>Once you have a common audience across email and social, engage this audience with activities that lend themselves well to both platforms.</p>
<p>Carry out contests using social media and email, with winners being showcased via both platforms as well. Conduct customer surveys or quick polls via email and social media with equal ease.</p>
<h2>9. Bridge the social gap</h2>
<p>On Facebook and Twitter, you can upload your email subscribers then target them with ads. It&rsquo;s a fast and efficient way to show them new products or encourage them to upgrade. You can also use those email addresses to find and follow your subscribers so you can start a two-way conversation with them on another platform.</p>
<h2>10. Gain deep customer insights</h2>
<p>Both email and social media offer brands a wealth of information regarding users. From detailed profile information of users, to their preferences, likes and dislikes, a peek into their social activities, how they engage with your brand, the type of content they consume, the content that results in actual sales and more can be obtained by putting together email and social media analytics.</p>
<p>Use this extensive pool of data to build unique customer profiles for each user. These 360 degree profiles would work best with the user&rsquo;s email ID as the central pivot around which all the data would be organized and would help in customizing content right down to each user&rsquo;s level to maximize the chances of conversions.</p>
<h3>To wrap up</h3>
<p>Americans now spending over 16 minutes per hour on social networks. Similarly, 75% of all online adults choose email as the preferred mode through which they would like to receive brand information.</p>
<p>A happy marriage between these two marketing powerhouses has the potential for some real fireworks in your marketing campaigns. So put aside your doubts and acknowledge the importance of both these platforms in their own right. Leverage their individual strengths and let them make up for each other&rsquo;s shortcomings to create a beautiful marketing symphony that users will enjoy!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>
<p><span id="more-3554"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/02/27-marketing-tips-thatll-woo-your-visitors-and-win-them-over/" target="_blank">27 Marketing Tips That&rsquo;ll Woo Your Visitors and Win Them Over</a></strong></p>
<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it. Just look at what someone emailed me today: &ldquo;This is Alice, founder of [WEBSITE], an art and culture blog that is now at 4 million uniques/month. You helped us tremendously in the beginning, and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for your valuable advice. I&rsquo;d like to see if you could help us get to the next level. Would love to work with you if you&rsquo;re available.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Give away guides</strong> &ndash; one of the most powerful forms of marketing I&rsquo;ve ever created is free guides. They are 30,000 to 40,000 words long, and they look beautiful. These guides are <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/06/10/how-i-turned-an-advance-guide-into-361494-visitors-and-8421-email-opt-ins/">this popular</a> because they contain everything I know, and you can have it for <em>free</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Care about your readers</strong> &ndash; have you noticed that I respond to every comment? It&rsquo;s because I care about you. I <em>really do</em>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;When I first started blogging, I didn&rsquo;t realize the benefit of responding to every comment. Now, I know that it helps me build a powerful connection with my readers, who become loyal visitors and even customers.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/startup-content-marketing/" target="_blank">30,000 Newsletter Subscribers in 12 Months (Startup Lessons Learned)</a></strong></p>
<p>This post isn&rsquo;t brand new but it&rsquo;s definitely evergreen. HelpScout&rsquo;s Gregory Ciotti talks about how they built a massive email list and exploded their traffic by pairing email and search engine optimization. It&rsquo;s a great read from one of the best marketers out there.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to simply distill some of the more important things I&rsquo;ve learned over these past 12 months and go over the fundamentals of how we made it happen.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>6. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/popup-defense/?hvid=2wHc7q" target="_blank">In Defense Of The Popup</a></strong></p>
<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/guest-blogging" target="_blank">How We&rsquo;ve Reached More Than 1 Million People by Guest Blogging</a></strong></p>
<p>Is your time better spent writing for your own blog or someone else&rsquo;s? Rand Fishkin calls guest blogging a slippery slope, since you are giving away authority that could be your own. Groove&rsquo;s Alex Turnbull, however, suggests otherwise.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3282" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/evergreen-content-ftw/guest-blog-visitors-signups/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?fit=640%2C492&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="640,492" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="guest-blog-visitors-signups" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?fit=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?fit=640%2C492&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-3282 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?resize=640%2C492" alt="guest-blog-visitors-signups" width="640" height="492" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?resize=300%2C231&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?resize=130%2C100&amp;ssl=1 130w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?resize=50%2C38&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/guest-blog-visitors-signups.png?resize=75%2C58&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234689" target="_blank">10 of the Most Counterintuitive Pieces of Advice From Famous Entrepreneurs</a></strong></p>
<p>Advice from founders is invaluable, especially when it&rsquo;s really off the beaten path. Beth Belle Cooper asked 10 entrepreneurs for their most counterintuitive advice and uncovered some fascinating insights. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These days, however, I live without goals, for the most part. It&rsquo;s absolutely liberating, and contrary to what you might have been taught, it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t mean you stop achieving things.</p>
<p>It means you stop letting yourself be limited by goals.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/improve-your-email-marketing-today/">6 Ways You Can Improve Your Email Marketing TODAY</a></strong></p>
<p>Why wait until tomorrow? Here are some very actionable tips you can put to good use right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Create an inbox swipe file.</li>
<li>Find every customer touch point.</li>
<li>Send an A/B test.</li>
<li>Learn to write better copy.</li>
<li>Segment your lists.</li>
<li>Upgrade your toolbox.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><strong>10. <a href="http://blog.leadpages.net/landing-pages-apple-borrow-apples-best-copywriting-techniques-copy/" target="_blank">Landing Pages by Apple</a></strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for tips on creating landing pages that convert like crazy, why not look at one of the most successful companies in the world? Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal &ndash; this landing page isn&rsquo;t really designed to get you to buy something right away.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about building excitement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about legitimate hype.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about craftsmanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s about placing you, the customer, squarely in the middle of it all.</p>
<p><strong>11. <a href="http://blog.qz.com/post/82007790924/how-we-doubled-our-email-sign-up-rate-by-reducing" target="_blank">How we doubled our email sign-up rate by reducing friction</a></strong></p>
<p>This post appeared on Quartz, one of my favorite sites, a few months ago but it&rsquo;s a great reminder that reducing friction is one of the best ways to drive conversions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since we rolled out the new system on February 19, our daily subscriber rate has doubled, even on weekends when activity dips considerably.

<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances.

With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed.

<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Where do you collect email addresses?</p>
<p>Not <em>how</em>, but <em>where</em>?</p>
<p>On your website and blog, right? Of course, but now there is a new place to collect email addresses: Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter has been allowing users to advertise on its platform for a while now, but <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170389">lead generation cards</a> are relatively new. Twitter explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What are Lead Generation Cards?</strong></p>
<p>The Lead Generation Card makes it easy for people to express interest in what your business offers &ndash; they can seamlessly and securely share their email address without leaving Twitter or having to fill out a cumbersome form.</p>
<p><strong>How do Lead Generation Cards work?</strong></p>
<p>When someone expands your Tweet, they&rsquo;ll see a description of the offer and a call to action. Their name, @username and email address (which they have previously entered in their Twitter settings) are already pre-filled within the Card. With a simple click of a button, the user can send this information directly to you.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-3044"></span></p>
<p>How cool is that? A Twitter user can give you their email address (in exchange for something of value) without typing a single character. Marketers are always trying to eliminate friction and this is one of the coolest and most useful friction-reducers we&rsquo;ve ever seen. In a single click, you can capture:</p>
<ul><li>Name</li>
<li>Twitter username</li>
<li>Email address</li>
</ul><p>So how can you get started for yourself? First, let&rsquo;s take a look at what you&rsquo;ll need:</p>
<ul><li><strong>A Twitter Ads account:</strong> You already have one. Just go to ads.twitter.com and sign in with your normal Twitter username and password.</li>
<li><strong>Something valuable to give away:</strong> No one is giving away their email address for free. Be prepared to offer a book, guide, webinar, course or something else valuable.</li>
<li><strong>A privacy policy:</strong> Because there is an exchange of sensitive contact data, you must show Twitter and Twitter users how that data will be handled.</li>
<li><strong>A credit card:</strong> Nothing is free. In fact, Twitter won&rsquo;t even let you go through the steps of creating a lead generation card without a valid credit card.</li>
</ul><p>Ready to get started? Head to <a href="https://ads.twitter.com">ads.twitter.com</a> and login.</p>
<h2>How to create lead generation Twitter Cards</h2>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/22fhzdvj8f" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="" msallowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Creatives,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="520px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Twitter-Card-Leads.png" alt="Twitter cards" width="520" height="112"></p>
<p>Next, click &ldquo;Create Lead Generation card.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="318px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/create-card.png" alt="create new Twitter card" width="318" height="106"></p>
<p>There are a number of fields you need to fill out before you can make your lead generation card live. We&rsquo;ll tackle each one individually to make sure you understand what is required and, more importantly, what is going to drive the most conversions.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="485px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/card-example.png" alt="example twitter card" width="485" height="563"></p>
<h3>Short description</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="363px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/short-description.png" alt="twitter card short description" width="363" height="138"></p>
<p>You only have 50 characters to make to grab a Twitter users&rsquo; attention and convince them to convert. It&rsquo;s no small task, and we recommend testing different descriptions to see what drives the most leads.</p>
<p>We are currently promoting our <a href="http://pages.getvero.com/the-marketers-email-conversion-course/">14-day email marketing course</a> with the description &ldquo;14 Days to Better Email and More Business.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Card image</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="392px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/card-image.png" alt="twitter card image" width="392" height="186"></p>
<p>Next up is the image. Again, space is limited so try to avoid filling it with useless information. A logo, for example, might take up too much room so try using some persuasive copy with your brand&rsquo;s colors and fonts.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="600px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/email-like-amazon.png" alt="send emails like amazon" width="600" height="150"></p>
<p>There are some pretty strict formatting rules so pay close attention. Images must be at least 600px x 15opx and maintain a 4:1 aspect ratio. If you aren&rsquo;t a designer, I recommend heading to <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva.com</a> and spending five minutes creating a beautiful image to go with your lead generation card.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Don&rsquo;t use their templates. Click &ldquo;Use Custom Dimensions&rdquo; and enter 600px by 150px.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one I created in just a few minutes:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="600px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image-second-option.png" alt="Image for Twitter card" width="600" height="150"></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-design-for-conversion/">Images drive conversions.</a> Spend time to get it right.</p>
<h3>Call to action</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="284px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/call-to-action.png" alt="twitter card call to action" width="284" height="122"></p>
<p>The entire Twitter card is essentially a call to action but in the official call to action field you only get 20 characters. The key here is to avoid friction words &ldquo;Sign up&rdquo; and &ldquo;Give.&rdquo; Words like imply commitment. Remember, this is Twitter, not your website. You haven&rsquo;t had the chance to earn their trust yet, so you need to be very careful with your copy here.</p>
<p>Try something committal and soothing, like &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; or something that implies value, like &ldquo;Get the guide.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Privacy policy URL</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="378px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/privacy-policy.png" alt="twitter card privacy policy" width="378" height="121"></p>
<p>This is required. If you are a SaaS business, you likely already have a privacy policy. If you don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have one anyway. No way around this one.</p>
<h3>Card Details (Fallback) URL</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="378px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/fallback-url.png" alt="card details fallback url" width="378" height="89"></p>
<p>Not everyone using Twitter is using a supported platform like Twitter.com and the official mobile apps. This link should take users to a landing page for the same offer you have using in the card, just in case the user is on a non-supported platform.</p>
<h3>Destination URL settings</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/destination-url-settings-640.png" alt="twitter card destination URL" width="640" height="292"></p>
<p>This section is optional but highly recommended. It controls what users see after they submit their information.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Destination URL&rdquo; is equivalent to a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; or &ldquo;Download&rdquo; page. Make sure you fill this out with something that will be a positive representation of your brand and useful to your new lead. A link to your homepage, for example, isn&rsquo;t that helpful.</p>
<p>If you are offering an e-book, you could send users to a download page. Or, if you are preparing for a webinar, you could send them an archive of old webinars to get familiar with your brand and expertise.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Post-submit message&rdquo; could be as simple as &ldquo;Thanks for signing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Check your email for your first lesson!&rdquo; You only have 100 characters so keep it short and sweet.</p>
<h3>Data settings</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/data-settings-640.png" alt="twitter card data settings" width="640" height="500"></p>
<p>The section deals with how your leads are handled once the user submits their data. You can use this section to connect Twitter&rsquo;s API directly to your database. If you are using <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/">Vero</a>, just let us know and we can help you do this.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t tech-savvy, fear not. You can skip this section and download the data from the Twitter Ads platform at any time.</p>
<h3>What would you like to name your card?</h3>
<p class=" small-image" style="356px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/namecard.png" alt="name your twitter card" width="356" height="117"></p>
<p>This is for internal use only, so just pick a name you will remember.</p>
<p>Once you create your card, you have the ability to preview it. From the Cards manager page (where you can see all of your cards), click the name of the card you want to preview.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="480px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/test-card.png" alt="preview twitter card" width="480" height="130"></p>
<p>On the next screen, click the &ldquo;View at&rdquo; link to see a preview.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="393px"><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/view-card.png" alt="view twitter card" width="393" height="322"></p>
<p>Here is what ours looks like: https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce53vaqd9/s7z</p>
<h2>How to use lead generation cards in real tweets</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to send your card in real tweets. For starters, you can simply tweet it to your followers. This is free and a great way to test your copy, images and call to action. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to test it with someone you know, like a co-worker, to make sure it&rsquo;s working properly.</p>
<p>To do this, simply click &ldquo;Compose Tweet with this card.&rdquo; You will see this screen:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/send-tweet-640.png" alt="send a tweet with twitter card" width="640" height="413"></p>
<p>Type a tweet as you normally would. You can include images, hashtags and other links but be sure to leave the cards.twitter.com link to include the card. Click &ldquo;Tweet&rdquo; and you are ready to start collecting new leads.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Our 14-day email marketing course has all the info you need to *kill it* with email <a href="https://t.co/SJJSvS0ywU">https://t.co/SJJSvS0ywU</a> &acirc;&#128;&#148; Chris Hexton (@chexton) <a href="https://twitter.com/chexton/statuses/477563800720121858">June 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Perhaps even more exciting is that you can use Twitter Ads&rsquo; campaign feature to target users that don&rsquo;t follow you. It allows you to refine a group of Twitter users with incredible accuracy. For example, you can target users who:</p>
<ul><li>Watch certain TV shows</li>
<li>Follow your competitors</li>
<li>Tweet about specific topics</li>
<li>Live near you</li>
</ul><p>If you have a list of cold emails, you can actually upload them to Twitter ads and use this as a way to warm them up to your brand. You can even use retargeting to put your tweets in front of people who have visited your website.</p>
<p>Twitter Ads campaigns are powerful and complex. Rather than dive into that here, check out <a href="https://business.twitter.com/">business.twitter.com</a> for tons of information.</p>

<html><body><p>First came search, then content marketing. And now, a compelling new marketing strategy has emerged: community building.</p>
<p>In the old days, SEO was considerably easier than it is today. A few links, some rich anchor text and next thing you know, you&rsquo;re getting tons of traffic from Google. Content marketing, which is essentially the process of making content that will rank and be shared, makes this process <em>a lot</em> harder. Your content has to be <em>really</em> good and <em>really</em> interesting in order for it to become a marketing tool.</p>

</ul></div>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-and-community-building/">Community building</a> takes content marketing to the next level. A good community is driven not by the marketing team, but by the users who come to participate in education and discussion. At Moz, one of the most well-known marketing tech companies of the last few years, the community is flourishing,<br>
thanks to a genuine desire to teach people about SEO and marketing, along with a bustling <a href="http://moz.com/community/q">forum</a>, <a href="http://moz.com/webinars">weekly webinars</a>, a 22,000-member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/SEOmoz-2976409?mostPopular=&amp;trk=tyah&amp;gid=2976409">LinkedIn group</a>, a community blog and active social channels. Users can create a free account to access the community, leave comments, get more information about upcoming events and test out Moz software.</p>
<p>Someone has to manage all that activity. At Moz, one of those people is senior community manager Erica McGillivray. Her job includes social media, content creation, customer service, SEO, public relations, event planning and email marketing. We caught up with Erica to ask her a few questions about Moz&rsquo;s community efforts and email strategy.</p>
<p><span id="more-2752"></span></p>
<p><strong>How does Moz use email to keep users informed and engaged?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> We have a lot of the typical &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; emails to continue community and/or customer interactions on the site &mdash; such as notices when other users answer Q&amp;A forum questions, blog comments, customer on-boarding information, and routine reports on customer&rsquo;s metrics. We also have a monthly customer newsletter, messages about major product updates or events, and a highly-curated <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10">Top 10 list</a> of online marketing articles.</p>
<p>Our Moz Top 10 list is mostly non-Moz links and drives a ton of traffic to the great work our community that&rsquo;s not on Moz.com. We&rsquo;ve had people tell us their blog traffic has tripled, sites have gone down, people have gotten new clients, and people have gotten speaking gigs by being included. This spreads a huge amount of goodwill in our community and also keeps people very engaged with us, so when we send them other emails, they&rsquo;re more likely to open them.</p>
<p><strong>How does your experience in email marketing help you in your role at Moz?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> I never forget when we should have an email capture form somewhere (but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I always get my way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p><strong>Are there any emails strategies that you find to be extremely effective?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> The most effective emails are the ones that are relevant to your audience. I know that sounds simple, but if you don&rsquo;t know how to slice and dice your contact lists into correct groupings and make sure you have the proper permissions to email them, you are missing opportunities.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/moz-email-open-rate-640.png" alt="Moz Email Open Rate" width="640" height="204"></p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m pretty focused on MozCon, our annual conference that&rsquo;s coming up in July, and we have a super targeted Events list that&rsquo;s slightly under 3,000 people. This is tiny compared to our Moz Top 10 list, which is 200,000+ people, but those on the Events list want to hear about MozCon.<strong> A recent email announcing the agenda had a 107 percent open rate</strong>, which means we had people coming back to the email multiple times and many bought tickets. (MozCon&rsquo;s $999 a ticket, so we&rsquo;d expect people to come back multiple times before buying and take time to consider the purchase.)</p>
<p><strong>How important is the inbox vs the social feed or SERP in 2014?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> Even in the era of easy spam reporting and Gmail&rsquo;s promotional tab, email is still more personal. Done well, it has a more direct impact than social media or search. (And I say that as someone who&rsquo;s an SEO and social media manager.) But because it&rsquo;s so in your customer&rsquo;s face, it&rsquo;s easier to make people angry if it&rsquo;s not tailored to them. They can pick another search result or ignore a tweet, but they have to do something with your email. And you don&rsquo;t want that something to be the delete button.</p>
<p><strong>Email is personal. Why do so many businesses treat it like a broadcast system?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Erica:</strong> It&rsquo;s hard for a lot of businesses to pivot. If you&rsquo;ve been sending blanket messages to your subscribers for years, it&rsquo;s hard to change. Especially if you&rsquo;re seeing some results. Never be afraid of changing or testing.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any resources that you recommend to other marketers and community managers?</strong></p>
<p>I always recommend coming to <a href="http://moz.com/mozcon">MozCon</a>, which is Moz&rsquo;s annual conference, July 14-16th in Seattle. For community managers, <a href="http://www.cmxsummit.com/">CMX Summit</a> is also fabulous.</p>

<html><body><p>Alexis Dubief is the founder and editor of the extremely popular parenting blog <a href="http://www.troublesometots.com/">Troublesome Tots</a>, where she provides resources to help kids sleep better. She is a blogging savior to young parents all over the world and, starting from scratch, has built an audience of over 1.5 million readers.</p>
<p>Learn more about her story, strategy and monetization plans for 2014.</p>
<p><span id="more-2677"></span></p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us about your background? Why did you start blogging?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexis:</strong> Before I had kids, I was a senior product manager at Apple with an MBA and MS Finance. Now I&rsquo;m a stay-at-home mom. I can say with all humility that the transition from professional to parent was not entirely smooth for me.</p>
<p>I started blogging in 2011 because I felt completely out of touch with technology and social media. I started writing about kids and sleep because it was something I was passionate about. I figured getting my hands dirty with WordPress would help me feel less out of the loop. I never expected anybody to read my little blog and I didn&rsquo;t start out with any intention to build a serious readership or monetize my content.</p>
<p>As my traffic and readership started to grow, I started taking it more seriously. I have a lot of pride in ownership. If my name is going to be on it, it has to be something I can be proud of. Also, I feel a huge sense of responsibility to my readers because I know what it&rsquo;s like to feel lost and insecure about being a parent. I know how vulnerable that person is who is awake at 3am looking for answers on the Internet. I try really hard to be a safe and helpful place for those people to land.</p>
<div style="font-style: oblique; font-weight: bold; width: 100%; font-size: 200%; line-height: 110%; color: #00befa; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; padding: 20px;">
<p>I feel a huge sense of responsibility to my readers because I know what it&rsquo;s like to feel lost and insecure about being a parent.</p>
</div>
<p>I get tons of email, hundreds a month. I don&rsquo;t have time to respond to them all anymore but I read them all. When I&rsquo;m researching and writing, I&rsquo;m thinking of those people and how I can help them.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any tools you cannot live without?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexis:</strong> Truthfully? No.</p>
<p>Evernote is as close to a &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; tool that exists in my toolkit. I have a premium PicMonkey account which I enjoy, although Pixlr is a fine, and free, alternative. I like the Mac iLife suite &acirc;&#128;&#148; iMovie, iPhoto, Pages &acirc;&#128;&#148; but I could soldier on without them. I occasionally use Buffer and ever since the demise of iGoogle and Google Reader, I&rsquo;ve started to enjoy the gentle charms of Feedly.</p>
<p>Recently, I purchased a copy of <a href="http://macfreedom.com/">Freedom</a>, a software tool that locks you out of the Internet for a set amount of time. I&rsquo;m an Internet diddler and hopeful that this $10 purchase will get me focused on writing. Ask me again in six months and it could well be the case that Freedom is the tool I can&rsquo;t live without.</p>
<p><strong>It looks like you are using affiliate links. Any tips for making the most of this revenue source?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexis:</strong> Amazon is a great affiliate program because:</p>
<ol><li>It&rsquo;s easy to setup,</li>
<li>Everybody shops there and</li>
<li>They sell everything under the sun.</li>
</ol><p>However, given the six to seven percent commission they pay, you need to write about high-value products if you want to generate real revenue. Thus, it&rsquo;s no surprise that the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; Amazon affiliate bloggers focus on expensive products like flat-screen TVs, laptops, and high-end cameras.</p>
<p>I write about babies, and most of the products I cover cost about $12. So while I sell a lot on Amazon each month, each sale nets me about $.50.</p>
<p>I believe the key to success for Amazon affiliate sales is that you are writing about products that are genuinely awesome and helpful to your readers. I don&rsquo;t recommend anything I wouldn&rsquo;t personally buy for a friend. I also will openly talk about products that I don&rsquo;t recommend and back it up with details. You are much more credible if you aren&rsquo;t just selling but honestly talking about why  something is or isn&rsquo;t useful.</p>
<p>Also, while Amazon offers a suite of plugins and widgets &acirc;&#128;&#148; all of which are quite ugly &acirc;&#128;&#148; to put product carousels all over your site, I think this approach is a mistake. Nobody minds an affiliate link to Amazon in the context of an honest book or product review. Just be wary of crossing the line from information provider to being an &ldquo;Amazon Storefront.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Do you have other plans to monetize your content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexis:</strong> I&rsquo;ve steered clear of advertising networks because they don&rsquo;t pay enough and I don&rsquo;t like the idea of cluttering my site with ads for products I wouldn&rsquo;t actually recommend. I&rsquo;ve heard too many horror stories from other parenting bloggers who were shocked to find &ldquo;baby coffin&rdquo; advertisements &acirc;&#128;&#148; and I wish I was kidding &acirc;&#128;&#148; on their site.</p>
<div style="font-style: oblique; font-weight: bold; width: 100%; font-size: 200%; line-height: 110%; color: #f26c4f; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; padding: 20px;">
<p>Frankly, there isn&rsquo;t enough money in the world to get me to market baby coffins.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2014, I plan to put more effort into developing individual relationships with sponsors, specifically companies with products I can believe in. Obviously, this is a far more time-consuming strategy than banner ads but it&rsquo;s ultimately one that feels more organic and hopefully will turn out to be worth the additional time and energy.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&rsquo;m working on a book. In weak moments, I worry that the world doesn&rsquo;t really need yet another baby sleep book, however, I&rsquo;m also pretty realistic about the amount of money &acirc;&#128;&#148; or lack thereof &acirc;&#128;&#148; to be made with a book. Although relative to the $.50 I currently make selling other people&rsquo;s books via Amazon, selling my own seems lucrative in comparison!</p>
<p><strong>Are you willing to share traffic metrics? What do you find drives the most traffic?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alexis:</strong> My site averages about 450,000 pageviews per month and there were 1.5 million unique visitors in 2013, far surpassing my wildest dreams for this blog.</p>
<p>By far my biggest driver of traffic is organic search. Here is my simple and successful approach to SEO:</p>
<ol><li>I focus on some basic keyword research and try to optimize each post for a unique term. This wasn&rsquo;t always the case and many of my initial posts are all competing with each other for the same keywords. I&rsquo;m deliberate about developing and optimizing around unique keywords for each post now and it&rsquo;s paying off.</li>
<li>I have a small but active <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AlexisDubief/posts">Google+</a> following and I&rsquo;m confident that much of the growth of my search traffic is directly related to my activity on Google+.</li>
</ol><p>My second biggest source of traffic &acirc;&#128;&#148; although it&rsquo;s a distant second &acirc;&#128;&#148; is Facebook. Pinterest has made its way into the top ten but that&rsquo;s mostly from other people pinning my content rather than my own activity on Pinterest. I do think a good Pinterest plugin is worthwhile for any blog owner.</p>
<p>In 2014, I want to experiment with guest posting on other blogs, something I&rsquo;ve never done in the past. We&rsquo;ll see if that is as valuable as <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/guest-blogging-jon-morrow/">Jon Morrow</a> suggests!</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>SEO has changed a lot over the last ten years. One thing that hasn&rsquo;t changed, however, is that Google reigns supreme. For all their efforts to clean up search engine result pages (SERPs), they often put their own business interests ahead of the best search results.</p>
<p><strong>Look no further than Google+ for proof.</strong></p>
<p>In the old days, doorway pages were a common black hat SEO technique. Doorway pages were built to rank for a keyword but sent users to a different (and often spammy) page. It was incredibly annoying for searchers but, by and large, Google has done away with them. Here&rsquo;s what Matt Cutts has to say about doorway pages:</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="338" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4zTKl_yz4Ro?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-2605"></span></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the quote I&rsquo;d like to highlight:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the history of which businesses have done well over time, you&rsquo;ll find the sorts of sites and the sorts of businesses that build websites that are built to stand the test of time. If someone is using a technique that is a gimmick, or the SEO fad of the day, that&rsquo;s a little less likely to really work well a few years from now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has been abusing it&rsquo;s own rule with <strong>Google+ doorway pages</strong>.</p>
<p>No doubt you&rsquo;ve come across these in your searches. You type in a search and your feed is filled with links to Google+ posts that link to article you actually want. <em>You have to pass through Google+ to get the content you are looking for.</em> Google calls this &ldquo;personalization&rdquo;. I call it an annoyance. But as a marketer, I must concede this a very real opportunity. First, let&rsquo;s look at a few examples, then examine how to take advantage of Google+ doorway pages to get more traffic.</p>
<h2>Example #1: Duplicate Content on SERPs</h2>
<p>We recently published a post titled <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/">50 Marketing Blogs You Should Read Every Day</a>. It&rsquo;s been <em>really</em> successful, to the tune of more than 4,000 social shares and 11,000 pageviews. So far, 336 of those shares have come from Google+ but when I search [what are the best marketing blogs], it doesn&rsquo;t show up on the first page.</p>
<p>It was published about three weeks ago, so I can understand why it&rsquo;s not ranking well yet. The interesting thing is that Vero does show up on the first page, except that it&rsquo;s a Google+ post, which links to a Copyblogger article. The actual Copyblogger article also ranks, just a few spots below. <img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/google-plus-doorway-pages.png" alt="Google+ Doorway Page Example" width="640" height="1103"></p>
<p>There are ten spots on the first page. Why is Google including the same article twice? Why does the Google+ doorway page rank higher than the article itself? These doorway pages are <strong>useless</strong> if the content is going to rank without Google+ anyway. I&rsquo;m trying hard to not to be biased, but there is no reason for a &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; Google+ result in this search. And it&rsquo;s not even the best result! Our list of must-read blog fulfills the search query much better, and it&rsquo;s nowhere to be found.</p>
<h2>Example #2: Utterly Useless Results</h2>
<p>Admittedly, I have skin in the game in the last example, so let&rsquo;s try one I can analyze with total objectivity. Let&rsquo;s try [which nikon camera should i buy].</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/google-plus-doorway-pages-bad-serps.png" alt="Google Plus Bad Search Results" width="640" height="1270"></p>
<p>There are 11 results on this page. The first ten provide a useful answer to my question. But number 11 &hellip; what happened here? This is a link to a Google+ post about Lexar memory cards. It has nothing to do with buying a Nikon camera and it sends searchers to a Google+ that then directs people to the actual blog post.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ol><li>The Google+ post isn&rsquo;t a relevant search result.</li>
<li>Google+ plus adds no value to the search, but gives Google+ a free pageview.</li>
</ol><h2>If You Can&rsquo;t Beat &lsquo;Em, Join &lsquo;Em</h2>
<p>Google seems to be ignoring their own advice. These doorway pages get in the way of the good stuff. But since it&rsquo;s hard &acirc;&#128;&#148; or impossible &acirc;&#128;&#148; to argue with Google, why not join them?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Researching via Google for a presentation and I keep finding the content I&rsquo;m looking for through what <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronwall">@aaronwall</a> calls G+ doorway pages <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Jon Henshaw (@RavenJon) <a href="https://twitter.com/RavenJon/statuses/456458151722614784">April 16, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: While these pages don&rsquo;t always offer the best results, sometimes they give smaller sites a chance to rank alongside &acirc;&#128;&#148; or even above &acirc;&#128;&#148; much bigger ones. Since Google+ posts are most likely to be seen by people in your circles, an influential and active Google+ user could affect a lot of search results. Here&rsquo;s what I mean.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/google-doorway-pages-benefits.png" alt="Advantages of Google+ Doorway Pages" width="640" height="1095"></p>
<p>The last two results on that SERP send people to articles I&rsquo;ve written on the topic. Would those articles rank alongside Wikipedia, Mashable, MacWorld and the University of Maryland without Google+? Probably not.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are a few ways to use Google+ doorway pages to your advantage:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Be active on Google+.</strong> Post content on your own account and a business account (if applicable). It&rsquo;s also a good idea to post on Community pages, leave comments and tag people in your posts.

<li><strong>Use Authorship.</strong> In this post, we looked at three SERPS with a total of 33 results. Sixteen of those results appeared with the author&rsquo;s image or the site&rsquo;s logo next to it. Not only does this draw searchers&rsquo; attention, it helps Google match your content to your Google+ page. They may tell this won&rsquo;t affect your ranks &hellip; choose to believe that at your own peril. Check out <a href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/google-authorship/">Jon Morrow&rsquo;s awesome guide to implementing and using Authorship</a> here.</li>
<li><strong>Write timely content.</strong> Very few sites are accepted to Google News but anyone can have a Google+ account. Google+ posts can be indexed very quickly, meaning if your site&rsquo;s content is being posted to Google+ immediately, you greatly increase your chances of ranking for time-sensitive topics.</li>
<li><strong>Go head to head with the big guns.</strong> Google+ doorway pages actually allow you to compete with huge websites. In my last example, I was able to get my small website on the same page as Wikipedia and Mashable. <strong>So write like you mean it.</strong> Google is constantly experimenting with Google+. They know the results aren&rsquo;t perfect but they also know that the biggest sites don&rsquo;t always have the best content.</li>

<html><body><p><strong><em>&ldquo;Buffer has become the startup standard-bearer when it comes to blogging.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we described Buffer&rsquo;s content marketing success in our list of <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/">must-read marketing blogs</a>. Buffer&rsquo;s explosive growth to more than 1 million users is due in large part to its strategic approach to content. They run two blogs &acirc;&#128;&#148; the popular <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Buffer blog</a> which covers productivity, life hacks, social media and marketing, and the <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Buffer Open blog</a>, which details the company&rsquo;s growth, values and even employee salaries.</p>

<p>Buffer recently hired a new Head of Content Marketing, <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/courtney-seiter-buffer-content-marketing/" target="_blank">Courtney Seiter</a>. When <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/about" target="_blank">Chris Hexton</a> and I saw this, we thought, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to pick her brain about content marketing?&rdquo; Luckily for us, Courtney agreed to chat about her new role, their approach to content and email marketing, and some of her favorite blogs and newsletters. Without further ado, meet Buffer&rsquo;s Head of Content Marketing, Courtney Seiter! <span id="more-2573"></span></p>
<p><strong>You are relatively new to Buffer &hellip; what were you doing before?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney: </strong>I&rsquo;ve been at Buffer since the beginning of February (2014) so just a few months now! Oh, gosh let&rsquo;s see &hellip; my pre-Buffer life has included a lot of different stuff. I was a freelance magazine writer in New York, a longtime newspaper reporter and editor and a SaaS community manager before coming to Buffer. Basically anything with words, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be in the middle of. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong>Buffer kills it with content. What is the secret to the success of the Buffer blog?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney: </strong>I feel so lucky to work with such a well respected and celebrated blog every day. Leo spills a lot of the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/5-key-lessons-we-learned-from-pivoting-our-blog" target="_blank">secrets of Buffer&rsquo;s success in this post</a>. The main one I focus on is the idea of <strong>&ldquo;Would anyone email this article to a friend?&rdquo;</strong> With that as our guiding principle, we try to make sure every piece we publish is thorough enough, unique enough and helpful enough to pass that test. Another thing I love about the Buffer blog is how much we, the content creators, are able to learn right along with our audience. We use a lot of studies and science to back up everything we write, and that&rsquo;s because the Buffer blog isn&rsquo;t really about entertaining you or offering up our own opinions about what you should do &ndash; it&rsquo;s about objectively experimenting and learning together.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen this deck referenced on the Buffer blog. It&rsquo;s from Moz, and it&rsquo;s pure gold.</em></p>

<p><strong>How do you and (Buffer Content Crafter) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevanlee" target="_blank">Kevan Lee</a> work together to tackle posts? Where do (co-founders) Leo and Joel fit in to the content strategy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney: </strong>It&rsquo;s a very communal, teamwork-oriented atmosphere at Buffer, which makes for a lovely and creative environment. This post <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/how-we-manage-a-blog-with-700000-readers-per-month" target="_blank">talks a good bit about our workflow</a>, but basically both Kevan and I &acirc;&#128;&#148; and really, anyone else at Buffer who wants to &acirc;&#128;&#148; contribute ideas to an ongoing Trello board as we think of them (which is sort of always!). Once a week, we&rsquo;ll go through the ideas and plan the week ahead. Once a month, Joel, Leo and I get together to talk high-level strategy and overall vision.</p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><strong>How do you divide your time between writing, promoting and strategizing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney:</strong> That&rsquo;s a really great question, and honestly something I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out. At the point, Kevan is Buffer&rsquo;s main writer, and he&rsquo;s producing a ton of really amazing stuff. On any given day I&rsquo;m talking to folks on social media, editing future content, finding great gems for <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/the-story-behind-buffers-newish-content-suggestions/" target="_blank">Buffer&rsquo;s content suggestions</a>, working on educational resources like webinars (we&rsquo;ve got one coming up <a href="http://webinars.bufferapp.com/webinar-172/" target="_blank">April 30 with Twitter for Small Business</a>) and looking at overall strategy &ndash; while still dipping into writing as often as I can, because I really enjoy it.</p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script><br><strong>How do you use email to drive traffic and engage readers? Do you use drip campaigns to convert free users to paid users, or focus on only building traffic to the blog?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney:</strong> Supersmart question! Working at Buffer means you&rsquo;re pretty much always in the middle of an experiment, which is so much fun. We&rsquo;re always learning. A lot of our latest experiments rely on email as a way to get new customers more active in Buffer and remind dormant customers of what we have to offer. So we&rsquo;ll maybe take a particular post that has performed well on the blog and email it out to customers who haven&rsquo;t posted in a while as a useful reminder about Buffer. And we&rsquo;ll use email to give you great content suggestions when your Buffer queue is empty, so even if you&rsquo;re new to Buffer you can begin to see right away how easy it is to share great content and get a response from your friends and followers.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any resources (books, blogs, people, etc.) that you would recommend to the content community?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Courtney:</strong> Definitely! Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-book-reading/" target="_blank">what we&rsquo;re reading lately</a> at Buffer. As for blogs/news sources, we read a lot of <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank">Zen Habits</a> at Buffer, I think <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em>&lsquo;s tech coverage</a> is great, and I adore the resurgence of unique, offbeat email newsletters like <a href="http://austinkleon.com/2013/12/22/my-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank">Austin Kleon&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings" target="_blank">Alexis Madrigal&rsquo;s</a>, <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/" target="_blank">Barking Up The Wrong Tree</a> and <a href="http://nextdraft.com/" target="_blank">NextDraft</a>.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>In the startup world, Twitter reigns supreme. It&rsquo;s also a largely untapped resource, mostly because it&rsquo;s incredibly overwhelming.</p>
<p>This post is designed to fix that. It&rsquo;s a curated look at the resources that have shaped my Twitter strategy and, more importantly, my Twitter philosophy. It may seem random, but I assure you the whole is great than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>Twitter, in a sense, is the ultimate startup. It has a storied and tumultuous history, plenty of drama, an astronomical growth curve and, now, a number of shareholders itching to know its next move. Working for a startup, I find that the history and philosophy of the businesses that make the tools I use can have a meaningful impact on the work I do.</p>
<p>Yes, new followers are important. And yes, driving traffic is important. But before you craft a social media strategy based on data alone, it&rsquo;s worth exploring the deeper meaning of sites like Twitter. An understanding of the history of each network, some background information on its founders and a few think pieces will help shape your vision and refine your strategy.</p>
<p><span id="more-2461"></span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also show you some of the awesome tools we use at Vero to grow and track our Twitter followers and traffic, but first, hear what Seth Godin has to say about Twitter.</p>
<h2>The Most Important Twitter Advice You&rsquo;ll Ever Receive</h2>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="338" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/r0h0LlCu8Ks?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>It all boils down to this: <strong>&ldquo;Networking is always important when it&rsquo;s real and always a useless distraction when it&rsquo;s fake.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Seth Godin doesn&rsquo;t use Twitter. As he <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/02/not-seth-godin.html" target="_blank">describes on his blog</a>, he can&rsquo;t focus on more than a few important tasks. Twitter would be a distraction without a full commitment.</p>
<blockquote><p>My reasoning is simple, and it has two parts. First, I don&rsquo;t want to use a tool unless I&rsquo;m going to use it really well. Doing any of these things halfway is worse than not at all. People don&rsquo;t want a mediocre interaction. Second, I don&rsquo;t want to add a layer of staff between me and the tools I use and the people I interact with.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one of the world&rsquo;s most successful marketers has opted <em>not</em> to use Twitter, what does that mean for the rest of us? It means, as Seth implies, that if we choose to use a social network, we should go all-in.</p>
<h2>The Important Story of @urtweetsrbad</h2>
<p>A lot of brands are tone deaf. Some are downright offensive. This isn&rsquo;t limited to Twitter, of course, but social media is an opportunity to expose your flaws to the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really too bad the @urtweetsrbad account was closed. This experiment, an idea hatched by a five-year social media veteran, simply retweeted bad brand tweets. The collective results were hilarious, and several brands blocked the account. A few blogs have archived the great works of @urtweetsrbad. Here are a few examples of the tweets they shared:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The most awkward places to experience, diarrhea? Go.</p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Pepto-Bismol (@Pepto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pepto/statuses/394516344429096960">October 27, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>RT IF YOUR DAD SOMETIMES WEARS A LEOPARD PRINT SNUGGIE! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23noshame&amp;src=hash">#noshame</a> &acirc;&#128;&#148; Snuggie&Acirc;&reg; Blanket (@OriginalSnuggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalSnuggie/statuses/395269043269414912">October 29, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>That moment before you drink a TEN and you realize the profound manliness of what&rsquo;s about to happen. &acirc;&#128;&#148; Dr Pepper TEN (@DrPepperTEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPepperTEN/statuses/395252159576813568">October 29, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Besides having a cold, the worst part about having a cold is that you can&rsquo;t smell your fresh sheets. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23flufact&amp;src=hash">#flufact</a></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&#148; Downy (@Downy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Downy/statuses/395224759539359744">October 29, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Since the account is no longer active, it&rsquo;s up to us, the marketing community, to pass the narrative along to future generations. <strong>Think before you tweet. If you don&rsquo;t have something interesting to say, consider not saying it all.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the more important lesson here is that brands were so self-conscious of their Twitter accounts, they blocked @urtweetsrbad. This utter lack of confidence in their strategy and philosophy made them easy prey. A better understanding of <em>why</em> they were tweeting in the first place might have guided the tweets they chose to send.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you check out this <a href="http://digiday.com/brands/bad-brand-tweet-hunter/" target="_blank">interview with the anonymous tweeter</a> behind it.</p>
<h2>The Twitter Articles You Should Read</h2>
<p>These articles will provide insight, humor and advice. Don&rsquo;t rush to read them all at once; it&rsquo;s worth saving them for a rainy day. Plus, it&rsquo;s a lot of reading.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/magazine/all-is-fair-in-love-and-twitter.html" target="_blank">All Is Fair in Love and Twitter</a></strong></p>
<p><em>New York Times</em> reporter Nick Bilton recently published a book called <em>Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal</em>. This article is an excerpt from the book, which details the interesting history of one of the most successful startups ever.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-01/twitter-the-startup-that-wouldnt-die" target="_blank">Twitter, the Startup That Wouldn&rsquo;t Die</a></strong></p>

<p>BuzzFeed tech editor Charlie explains how and why he reached &ldquo;Twitter Zero.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an interesting look at our collective Twitter addiction and the state of the &ldquo;feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/04/should-you-tweet" target="_blank">Should You Tweet?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post from <em>The Awl</em>&lsquo;s John Herrman starts with the basics, but goes on to detail everything that is wrong and hilarious about the state of Twitter in 2014.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1. What is Twitter?</strong></p>
<p>Twitter is a website.</p>
<p><strong>2. What is a website?</strong></p>
<p>The collective plural of content.</p>
<p><strong>3. What is content?</strong></p>
<p>A unit of website.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now that Twitter is a publicly traded company, it&rsquo;s time for it to grow. But <em>Quartz</em> reporter Christopher Mims wants to know what that means. He asks some pressing questions about the future of Twitter.</p>

<h2>The Best Twitter Tools</h2>
<p>Twitter tools are plentiful, but most of them aren&rsquo;t worth your time. A few, however, can provide really useful data to shape your social strategy. Here are the ones we use at Vero.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a no-brainer, and a must-have. We use Buffer to schedule all of our content. Not only does it help us keep track of clicks, retweets and favorites, but it also centralizes our social schedules. The Awesome plan (which we currently use) allows multiple contributors to add content to the schedule. The Business plan (which we are free-trialing now) adds deeper analytics. Even the free plan is great, however, and it&rsquo;s the easiest way to keep track of posts for multiple social media sites.</p>

<p>Twitter moves fast, so automation is extremely helpful. No robot can replace a thoughtful tweet, but the simple power of IFTTT can save you some much-needed time. Basically, IFTTT allows you to connect your Twitter account to other apps. For example, if I favorite a tweet, IFTTT automatically adds it to my Buffer queue. You can also add items from an RSS to your Twitter or Buffer account or automatically save certain tweets to Pocket.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes?channel=twitter">list of all the things you can do with Twitter on IFTTT</a>.</p>

<p>JustUnfollow provides a ton of data that Twitter doesn&rsquo;t bother to tell you. As the name implies, you can see who has unfollowed you, and you can unfollow users based on their tweet frequency. (Remember, too much or too little tweeting can get you unfollowed.)</p>

<p>I occasionally use this feature to clean up the list of people I follow, and the results are liberating. Each morning, they send me an email letting me know who has followed and unfollowed me in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/i-nuked-my-twitter-feed-and-you-should-too" target="_blank">nuke your Twitter feed</a>, it&rsquo;s refreshing to clear out all the accounts that clutter your feed with white noise. As Dennis K. Berman wrote in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, a Twitter purge feels great.</p>
<blockquote><p>Monitoring my stream of 1,050 &acirc;&#128;&#156;follows&acirc;&#128;&#157; has felt like watching an infinite auto race, with tweets streaming by in packs and bursts, emitting a toxic data roar. Twitter literally gives me headaches.</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes, I had cut my list from about 1,050 to 660. The most effective change was un-following a handful of prolific &acirc;&#128;&#156;volume Tweeters.&acirc;&#128;&#157; That has made the toxic roar a more manageable hum. And that encourages me to return to Twitter more.</p></blockquote>

<p>We all want to keep close tabs on the number of followers we have. While Twitter sends notifications when someone new follows you, they don&rsquo;t provide much data on follows over time. And they certainly don&rsquo;t let you compare your follower growth with other metrics, like tweet frequency.</p>

<p>Finally, a way to search for content that is popular on social media. Buzzsumo looks only at social signals to serve search results. For example, if I search for the term &ldquo;email marketing,&rdquo; it ranks relevant articles by the total shares they received on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and Pinterest. By toggling the filters on the left sidebar, I can see what is popular this week, or what has been popular over the last six months.</p>
<p>Refine your search to find infographics, videos or text articles, and then choose the ranking method (most tweets, most Facebook &ldquo;likes&rdquo;, most total shares, etc.).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Australia&rsquo;s love affair with online shopping is a gift that keeps on giving. While more than a quarter of us shop online once a week, we&rsquo;re shunning overseas sites in growing numbers, preferring to spend our cash on domestic sites. Indeed, 79 percent of Australians who shop online mostly spend their cash on local websites.</p>
<p>Some online shoppers are explicitly seeking out local merchants to mitigate some of the risks, ensure friendly return policies and guarantee quality goods; for other shoppers, it&rsquo;s all about supporting local retailers.</p>
<p>This is great news for local merchants who are willing to capitalise on the preference for shopping locally.</p>
<p>Many emerging Australian startups are dedicated to making online shopping an easier process and are creating opportunities for businesses to bolster their sales. Here are five innovative ideas to consider in 2014.</p>
<p><span id="more-2454"></span></p>
<h2>1. Optimise Your Product Display</h2>
<p>Quicker than ever before, online shoppers are making decisions about what they like and don&rsquo;t like, switching across websites in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>By offering a 3D display of your digital range, Aussie e-commerce innovator <a href="http://thereitis.com/" target="_blank">Thereitis 3D Display</a> can visually engage shoppers and bring your items to life.</p>
<p>The Adelaide startup has created cutting-edge technology that uses our human ability to skim through images quickly and optimises keyword search, category and price filters to make shopping online even easier.</p>
<p>It works particularly well with mobile devices, where users tend to navigate the screen using touch instead of mouse clicks.</p>
<p>The technology allows customers to more comprehensively judge products before purchase. As an example, the 3D technology increased conversion rates for a pendant on gifts.com by seven times.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://thereitis.com/" target="_blank">Thereitis</a>, and watch the video below.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/22IJCF7YS8I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>2. Increase Trust Levels</h2>
<p>Imagine allowing your customers to touch your online products before paying for them, without risking broken or lost inventory.inventory.</p>
<p>Sydney startup <a href="http://www.touchpayments.com.au/" target="_blank">Touch Payments</a> promises that customers won&rsquo;t ever have to pay for a product they haven&rsquo;t touched &acirc;&#128;&#148; a major bonus for promoting the concept of secure online shopping.</p>
<p>When shoppers choose Touch Payments at checkout, there are no credit card details to enter (no extra forms to fill out, no traditional credit checks) and nothing to pay at the time of purchase. Instead, customers are invoiced for their orders and receive their merchandise before having to make a payment.</p>
<p>Once an order ships, shoppers have up to 16 days (no interest or other fees) to pay the invoice through any of the following payment options: BPAY, bank transfer, credit card, debit card or even cash at Australia Post. Touch Payments assumes the risk, which means Touch always pays the merchant, no matter what.</p>
<p>By mitigating risk and offering quality assurance to even the most sceptical browsers, Touch Payments offers an increased trust level and a greater conversion rate for your shop. Delayed payment has increased conversion rates by up to 30 percent overseas.</p>
<p>As the first startup of its kind in Australia, Touch wants to show you how you can benefit. Get in <a href="http://www.touchpayments.com.au/" target="_blank">Touch</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Reinvent Delivery</h2>
<p>In a market obsessed with speedy delivery times, consumers expect their purchases to arrive almost instantly. This year, market-savvy merchants will enhance their sites with <a href="http://parcelpoint.com.au/" target="_blank">ParcelPoint</a>, a solution that addresses the problem of missed deliveries.</p>
<p>ParcelPoint partners with couriers to allow consumers to direct their parcels to a nearby shop within a network of stores, from news agents to convenience stores, which will hold a parcel until the customer is ready to collect it, seven days a week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a convenient solution for people who don&rsquo;t want purchases delivered to their homes or work or who are unavailable during regular 9-5 delivery times.</p>
<p>Some retail partners only use the service to facilitate fast returns, because returns don&rsquo;t require changes to the retailer&rsquo;s e-management system.</p>
<p>ParcelPoint has over 1,000 pick-up locations and is worth investigating as a way to provide more convenience to your customers.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://parcelpoint.com.au/" target="_blank">ParcelPoint</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Introduce Alternative Payment Options</h2>
<p>Melbourne startup <a href="https://www.coinjar.com/" target="_blank">CoinJar</a> is another newcomer that is shaking things up in the e-commerce space.</p>
<p>In response to the recent boom in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> transactions, CoinJar&rsquo;s young founders identified a gap in the market for an easy-to-use digital wallet for buying, selling and accept bitcoin as a merchant. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that avoids having to pay bank fees and absorb exchange-rate losses.</p>
<p>With more than 20,000 Aussie users, both Bitcoin and CoinJar make it easier to purchase goods online.</p>
<p>CoinJar eases the way for merchants to start accepting bitcoin payments and offers solutions that allow buyers to use the currency. It&rsquo;s cheaper than accepting credit card payment: The retailer&rsquo;s fee is 1.1 percent per transaction.</p>
<p>Given that CoinJar offers complete security when making digital payments, these sorts of applications to your site could give Australians looking for alternatives to PayPal and other established methods a virtual nudge into the online world.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.coinjar.com/" target="_blank">CoinJar</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Use Social to Sell</h2>
<p>Finding customers where they already are is a massive advantage.</p>
<p>U.S. startup <a href="http://new.soldsie.com/landing/" target="_blank">Soldsie</a> allows you to sell directly, via social media. By simply commenting on a picture posted on your fan page, your customer has the opportunity to order straight from your online shop by logging on to Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Soldsie manages the process and makes it simple so that merchants wanting to take the headache out of selling on social media can focus on existing e-commerce channels and directly monetise social media followers.</p>
<p>Best of all, Soldsie now treats spam comments as regular comments, meaning they will be parsed without any additional work on your part.</p>
<p>Comments create conversion rates of four times more than links, and Soldsie claims that use of Soldsie has increased sales by a whopping 300 percent for its merchant partners.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>These five email strategies from the worlds largest media sites like Tumblr will help you increase user engagement and conversion too.</p>
<p>Tumblr sites get over <strong>20 billion page views per month</strong>.</p>
<p>Online media is changing rapidly. Whilst old-world media outlets and newspapers rapidly try to work out how to stay relevant and monetize in an online world, ad networks and new-age media like Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest are exploding.</p>
<p>One thing in all of this is clear: savvy, successful publishers <strong>understand the power of email</strong> to increase user engagement, readership and revenue.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>five email marketing tactics you can learn from the best in the publishing industry</strong>.</p>
<p>You can apply each of them your own business, no matter what you sell.</p>
<p><span id="more-1086"></span></p>
<h2>1. Personalization, personalisation, personalisation</h2>
<p>The name of the game in publishing is to serve customers articles they want to read.</p>
<p>Ensuring customers are engaged and the maximum amount of time on your site means more advertising revenue. New-age publishers like Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest really lead the charge when it comes to email personalisation.</p>
<p>Tumblr&rsquo;s <em>recommendation</em> newsletters are a great example of A/B testing at work. Their variations range from the visually dynamic (this was an animated GIF):</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Automated email Tumblr trending" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2610?token=27Abu6Bx1DUdpSUHPgjcEBWVQVcW1VuG4d_ny7ItSRcJZTxoI7G7u4DShUdlt3V3IGkTELfx8u44tG9o1YUXKgM"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;to the experimental:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Behavioral email campaign Tumblr Go" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2609?token=uDxaYdJMPc7d66NLu-6BJlkrrTHIjKzBHh5hBmSpGOUWttqLgMnhXMo809UaEW9TqYC43HoGqS4ytdJ6Rf9rbFY"></p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter use your followers, people you follow and trending data to recommend new tweets that are personally relevant to you:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter what is trending email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2608?token=HW5vn9WQ-nCQWFUetwh4UM_l7tQYkVpTsuhtQemSvRmReyPgfgvGl4Jz6yBV69Ju-rhhWlACTwFGzvOq9Q5l4dM"></p>
<p>The point of the this campaign is to get you more engaged in Twitter, to ensure you spend more time on the site and, of course, to get you to generate more awesome content.</p>
<p>To round out examples of personalisation, Pinterest recently sent this email to our inbox, a great example of how targeted you can be:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Pinterest targeted email marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2607?token=6hNRlE6fahMPx2qyiqbLbSvX35eIJtjfVaMzc7CX6XRkkwUR3MZHOEm3OihACOMUJIniRBZ8sd6hXnEcErSuDTs"></p>
<p>Personalization based on customer actions on your site and their interactions with your content is the holy grail (like the above).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to achieve but Pinterest and others show that with the right tools it can be achieved.</p>
<h2>4. Roll out the red carpet for new customers</h2>
<p>Publishers like DailyCandy and Nerdiest make tens of millions of dollars a year, primarily thanks to their large subscriber databases.</p>
<p>Just like eCommerce stores and SaaS businesses, your customers&rsquo; initial experience with your business is a vital one.</p>
<p>SIgn up is your best (perhaps only) chance to truly impress your customers. It&rsquo;s the perfect time to welcome and educate.</p>
<p><a href="http://dailycandy.com">DailyCandy</a> send out a welcome email like the one below. It&rsquo;s a fantastic example of great email copy. It has the right tone, perfectly representing DailyCandy&rsquo;s brand, such as <em>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re the only one with bills to pay?&rdquo;</em>. Plus, it aims to make the recipient feel special: <em>You&rsquo;re one of us now.</em></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Welcome email DailyCandy" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2606?token=XEHvepybIQ4AVHI8XHAF1qQTT2z_Y00Ao5ySzZjurqDG9QMrg5sG6C09-6wUPIIyeJBF6w9j17yZfNYaSqOQiWo"></p>
<p><a href="http://nerdist.com">Nerdist</a> do a similar thing, welcoming new users. They make it clear that a) they can unsubscribe at any time and that b) they should add Nerdist to their contact book. Both smart tactics: being open and honest about unsubscription helps build an engaged list whilst getting into your customer&rsquo;s address book increases deliverability rates.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Nerdist Welcome Email Campaign" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2605?token=MekstglPCNWusx6WaoSi8VclmVRpbLkYLp7JFDZ2OrjKhRjurRZOHDPAnY9tjhLtDVh6wypMXtESxEryUehOJ3E"></p>
<p>A great campaign idea, regardless of the industry, is to target new signups that haven&rsquo;t yet actually interacted with your site with a different strategy.</p>
<p>This sounds obvious but is done less than it deserves to be. These days it&rsquo;s super easy to track when a customer signs up and super easy to track all of their actions.</p>
<p>For example, rather than continuing to bombard customers that haven&rsquo;t interacted with your business you could this drastically different approach, like Fab.com:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Fab.com automatically unsubscribe customers" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2604?token=HDtHNxrRHDdAQJETEdZ_bXOCtbSBjlQMxlLkJHPAPdeFir1iBVge3wB153vltMNavRb-b-JKTNkkdjTYa1F6ZuM"></p>
<p>You should use the opportunity of targeting this segment as a golden chance to get them re-engaged in your product. If an email like the one from Fab above doesn&rsquo;t get attention then nothing will!</p>
<h2>3. Drive your customers to re-purchas wherever possible</h2>
<p>Online publishers make money via online advertising.</p>
<p>Some publishers control their own ad platforms whilst others earn revenue through intermediaries like Google AdSense. Google are extremely adept at using lifecycle email to get AdWords customers spending more.</p>
<p>Not only do Google focus on getting you activated with AdWords quickly:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="AdWords Welcome Email Campaign" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2603?token=-VGjz1yOfpHGWDubmrV_wxpnavdEXWYzIf9hyKWXEn0ZhlWF1pvBJ19YcSrl8zinopPTJB7X5UrzqaWTB_zlq-A"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;they also send you lifecycle emails at key points in your engagement with the product that focus on three things:</p>
<p>1) Keeping your account topped up,<br>
2) Getting you to create <strong>new</strong> ads,<br>
3) Ensuring your ads make you more and more money (increasing LTV).</p>
<p>All of these approaches aim for the same goal: increasing your spending on the network.</p>
<p>Their reminder emails are simple, like the one below:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="AdWords Email Running Low" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2602?token=COkEs87MjGShKYOeIzK0fchfPO4I09mnJ4lfbVKJFOtlXyx4-Erdy9wQXYWYuKEYvHXpNrpyLYwRr92IoqKdQIg"></p>
<p>Whilst their emails designed to get your creating more effective and diverse ads are a little more sophisticated:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="AdWords Email Try This Feature" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2600?token=PnASs42Xsj9pDBAuVRXzYO5poMwt2pUuB8sJBrfniARED1Xq6TAN9ULDlJ03xVeZyRR6jazco1Oy2xUezs1dgaw"></p>
<p>These emails work well as they use statistics and personalised content in conjunction with targeted events to convert recipients.</p>
<p>LinkedIn are increasingly a large publisher of user-generated content. They also run their own ad network.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example from LinkedIn that aims to get business users to start using their paid ads:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="LinkedIn Buy Ads" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2599?token=8qVWIoSyPUafectlV2bgHuX89fht-C3ahm6SuhPhgzFHZskBPDotzNdPYnyk6MsNlEmHn1dn3IaLCeTt16RwOec"></p>
<p>Twitter do something similar, letting their customers know about their new ad platform. This is an example of a great newsletter they sent that harnesses social proof and the recipient customer&rsquo;s own details to great success:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter Ad Platform Email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2598?token=jq2qXWtKRDIBbym-tTnA6jiWfjWYEo1oCDAujA6UKtMWOIynxOb4UYylEv0eeRgohxsbs7Z9mMjvfe-k2bDG74Q"></p>
<p>Perfect Audience are a Facebook and display retargeting platform that use email a <strong>lot</strong>. They use the power of psychology to make advertisers feel good, with emails like this &lsquo;conversion success&rsquo; notification:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Perfect Audience Conversions" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2597?token=Bm8i-cDFLpVR8Wt8n4wYIHGLatmPFrUBcqNJiXOU9MEDNFvVN3b8150RP1o6CCPItO3YMFusjn08KHsAX_cWc1I"></p>
<p>They also send out summary emails designed to emphasise the impact their platform is having on your business.</p>
<p>If you work with or manage your own advertising platform then email is an extremely effective tool to get your customers <strong>spending more for longer</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about striking the right tone and the right time. Data-driven segmentation is the key here.</p>
<h2>4. Social and email play nicely together</h2>
<p>Building on the Twitter example in part one, Twitter also use personalised data to recommend profiles you should follow:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter email people you know" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2596?token=jZAOo8xDWO0q7o6SPkAVcEpwBb_4Aql5O4dYYrtXpmetFyq83J7H7zkjTBNG029e_B_9XuYBPoZrX2JKb44MnLs"></p>
<p>Twitter makes great use of the extremely detailed data they have to give you recommendations that are relevant, keeping you on the platform.</p>
<p>Twitter is built around social, so this is only natural. Thinking about what you can do to encourage social sharing of your own content can begin with most basic social integration &ndash; Facebook and Twitter share or profile buttons in the sidebar:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Nerdist social email marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2595?token=GCvYrfB7Sb1NtHzj-44poUwPf6Ll0RnHAL-YARSa8tr5JtzfUvSJlp8ddBYnNR76rpJtIotacByuTDuxn24Ebdk"></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not doing this, then shame on you.</p>
<p>For an example of innovative thinking and a really interesting case of combining social data with publishing data comes from Disqus.</p>
<p>Disqus are not a publisher, per se, but they are an increasingly important part of the online blogging world and recommendations within that sphere.</p>
<p>Their digest emails connect you with the comments you&rsquo;ve made, where you&rsquo;ve made them and responses from other readers. This is an interesting subset of email marketing within the publishing world and food-for-thought on how you might use your own commenting system or recommendations to build a community:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Disqus digest email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2594?token=R5NINPbJpN7N8a8h-XcYTzYq5m6yRv78UMIgSDXXI-TcjEC_cUfmbvviIVRaeMdCR7_k4XHd75Q8QnntfIkW24w"></p>
<p>Always think outside the box!</p>
<p>Combining social data into the emails you&rsquo;re already sending makes sense: it gives you an instant increase in your reach by leveraging your readers&rsquo; networks.</p>
<h2>5. Advertise and cross-sell like crazy</h2>
<p>Advertising <strong>in</strong> email campaigns and cross-selling related products is something publishers are particularly good at.</p>
<p>Companies like DailyCandy have many promotional emails that directly reference product offers or sales. They do so in an editorial way, blurring the lines between direct selling and publishing.</p>
<p>Take this example selling Mara and Mine shoes:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="DailyCandy Shoes Offer Email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2593?token=zhJJCkcpMRcs5rD3fIln1UwIvaEckTARFALayosl46D36xAEbJ4aDDNgpLr9QZQl9m1J5CSg5hNLMbMe90QsU3Y"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;or this example for Dove deodorant:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="DailyCandy Email Marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2592?token=9VYP1bPsFt3S5oI-99266s3nj6OhQh7m2SXAdypLdHS6DUSmNWmgWdd_FWWwmVd1uZ6PMH9yDKTPR96LYUfB1Qo"></p>
<p>Segmenting your list and advertising <strong>related products</strong> to potentially interested consumers is a money-making machine.</p>
<p>Monocle, a UK-based paper magazine, is a savvy publisher too. They use their newsletter to sell their own branded products and to cross-promote content, partnerships and other tidbits from around their network:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Monocle Offer Email" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2612?token=rcbvdhF9FaxV4PGNYfwB2_L-Cz5i1AcPNVsOkfitLxMO68WFmsg-7LpJY2amEcIePqai4BAAZhIraI7f-VHznfs"></p>
<p>Perhaps most effective (and even a little ironic <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the way Monocle use their email list to convert subscribers to their print magazine (the core of the business):</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Monocle Print Edition Offer Email Marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2589?token=v7ffhWINl0AjNUydKPe3rWPTnb0z8V5vmbtZsGgRqgWswjg4gpo_6vkYHxPykxVIYBH4PcQigXcKYWcFKBDCSQc"></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re employing the strategy of sending offers to your readers then your focus should be on segmentation. Without segmentation it&rsquo;s unlikely your cross-sell will lead to conversions, sales and revenue.</p>
<p>This tactic can work for anyone and in comes in many forms. Here&rsquo;s an example from Verizon:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Verizon up sell email marketing" src="https://draftin.com:443/images/2584?token=pl9KC9zo1YJ02PoRrfrRcHzy-AKI2gDm_Zy9_rm8rMWZztaZNPnUCtax4S08TPTtA12IgF-Pwje4omPJsROnmc0"></p>
<p>Another example of a subtle but effective upsell in an otherwise completely transactional email.</p>
<p>Think about each and every email you send as an opportunity to upsell and create &lsquo;expansion&rsquo; revenue for your business.</p>
<p>Think about what other features, products or content you can share to get customers more engaged with your business instantly.</p>
