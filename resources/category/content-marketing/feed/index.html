<html><body><p>This is our fourth blog report. You can read the others here.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/january-2015/">January 2015 report</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/february-2015/">February 2015 report</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/march-2015/">March 2015 report</a></li>
</ul><p>I&rsquo;ll get into some numbers but first, there are a few other things I want to touch on.<span id="more-6240"></span></p>
<h2>Adjusted Bounce Rate</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always hated the way Google Analytics handles bounce rate but never knew how to fix it. In early April, I received an email from Caroline Krolicka from <a href="http://growbots.com/" target="_blank">Growbots</a>. She noticed in our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/march-2015/">March report</a> that our bounce rate was over 80% and pointed me to a new metric: <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/sew/how-to/2322974/how-to-implement-adjusted-bounce-rate-abr-via-google-tag-manager-tutorial#">adjusted bounce rate</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of using Google&rsquo;s standard formula &ndash; anyone who views just one page is counted as a bounce, even if they stay for five minutes &ndash; I created a new one. In our case, I decided to count all visits shorter than 30 seconds as a bounce.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6241" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/april-2015/adjusted-bounce-rate/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?fit=800%2C167&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,167" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="adjusted bounce rate" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?fit=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?fit=800%2C167&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6241" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png" alt="adjusted bounce rate" width="800" height="167" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?resize=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?resize=50%2C10&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/adjusted-bounce-rate.png?resize=75%2C16&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Our bounce rate immediately dropped from over 80 percent to below 20 percent. I believe this to be a <em>much</em> more accurate indicator of interest. Thanks Caroline!</p>
<h2>Quality Over Quantity</h2>
<p>We only published eight posts in April, down from our normal 10 or 12. The reason is because we&rsquo;re making a few changes in the way we approach content. That means deeper dives into specific topics, nitty gritty tutorials (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/the-retention-email/">like our Airbnb one</a>), more attention to design and, in general, fewer posts. Keep an eye out for some great resources coming soon.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbers (on the blog subdomain)</strong></p>
<ul><li>Pageviews: 67,195 (-2.87%)</li>
<li>Average time on site: 4:05 (+22.14%)</li>
<li>Bounce rate: 44.58% (-44.37%)</li>
<li>Organic search visits: 19,371 (+10.65%)</li>
</ul><p>Even with fewer new posts, organic traffic is still on the rise. It improved almost nine percent to 23,100 total organic visits (to the<a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/"> main site</a> and the blog).</p>

<p>I had the distinct pleasure of interviewing Death to the Stock Photo&rsquo;s David Sherry about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/death-to-the-stock-photo/">building a profitable business with email</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t read this post&Acirc;&nbsp;yet, I&rsquo;d encourage you to check it out. Here are a few gems from the article:</p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;We segment based on hunger,&rdquo; says David. &ldquo;We know that when people engage a lot, they have a pain point. We relieve that by sending them more content.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;A lot of companies will say &lsquo;Join our list and get a free e-book.&rsquo; We don&rsquo;t say that. But when people sign up, we give them something free. It&rsquo;s a nice surprise.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We just try to tune into our audience. We&rsquo;ve never paid attention to time or day,&rdquo; David says. &ldquo;Most email marketers will say you should email at least once a week. But we just do what feels right.&rdquo;</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/death-to-the-stock-photo/">Check out the full article here.</a></p>
<p>We also hosted a webinar showing you how to use Vero to send behavioral email campaigns. You can watch a recording here (or below). We&rsquo;ll be doing more of these on a variety of topics in the coming months.</p>

<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s important to understand when to sell your product and when to learn more about your potential customers.</p>
<p>Many marketers believe that acquiring an email address is the only thing standing between them and a sale. Once they can start the drip campaign, the deal is as good as sealed.</p>
<p>Like all businesses, we are learning through trial and error. I want to share a quick story from our own marketing to illustrate something that most marketers struggle with: selling vs. learning.</p>
<p>When I started with Vero about a year ago, we created a 14-step autoresponder that we sent to all new blog subscribers. The goal? To get them to signup for a Vero free trial.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of how that campaign looked (we actually published the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-email-campaign/?hvid=4BNoK">first five emails here</a>):</p>
<ul><li>Email #1: Welcome to the blog</li>
<li>Email #2: Explain what Vero does</li>
<li>Email #3: Offer discount for new users</li>
<li>Email #4: Survey on improving the blog</li>
<li>Email #5: Content</li>
<li>Email #6: Webinar</li>
<li>Email #7: Webinar follow-up (sent only to people who watched)</li>
<li>Email #8: Offer discount to people who watched webinar</li>
<li>Email #9: Content</li>
<li>Email #10: Content</li>
<li>Email #11: Another survey on the blog</li>
<li>Email #12: Video of Chris&rsquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GprD6JZSrec" target="_blank">presentation at Startmate&rsquo;s conference</a></li>
<li>Email #13: Content</li>
<li>Email #14: Content</li>
</ul><p>We sent that campaign to more than 2,000 people. Open rates ranged from 28 percent on the low end to 86 percent on the high end. We followed every <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">email marketing best practice</a> in the book. We even heard great feedback from some of our readers.</p>
<p>Yet we netted just a handful of new signups from that campaign because we fell prey to a common misconception about content and email marketing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how many people think this process should work:</p>
<ul><li>Step 1: Use targeted content to drive email signups</li>
<li>Step 2: Use drip campaigns to send content and offers</li>
<li>Step 3: IPO</li>
</ul><p>If only it were that simple.</p>
<h2>Why We Put Learning First</h2>
<p>The reason our campaign failed is because we put selling before learning.</p>
<p>When a new person subscribes to our blog, we <em>know</em> they are looking for more information about email marketing because it&rsquo;s clearly stated in the opt-ins.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/28552?token=L-Ma97FobnzioP8IWYeN-HC8-7vVr2hdBk4gjvp1vDI2B3JhbPGEvlMnptr4QfiGLZ_089DbN5nMC1H2QT-k6aw" alt="vero newsletter signup 1.png"></p>
<p>But we really don&rsquo;t know if they are looking for a new email marketing tool. Or if they are in a position to make a purchase.Or if they would even be a good fit as a Vero customer. Assuming that every person interested in your content is also interested in your product is a fundamental mistake.</p>
<p>We learned that lesson by sending 19,849 emails that didn&rsquo;t do much (that&rsquo;s the total number of emails triggered in the campaign).</p>
<p>It was time for a drastic change so we scrapped the campaign and replaced it with a single email.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/28557?token=4c8ZxrLgQSh27xAnp1ZGLZuS9EAmAJY0qgr2YoO--UgUbRfnAh2W3JRT7RT2xOan3pVTgnuOURpkqGOylCFxcGc" alt="vero welcome email reply.jpg"></p>
<p>Not everyone responds but many do. In fact, more than 40 people responded in the first two weeks and I get few more responses each day. We are learning a ton.</p>
<p>For example, some people are just getting started with email marketing. They are nowhere near ready to use Vero. Some have very specific use-cases. The webinars and content in our previous campaign would be way too general.</p>
<p>Even an email marketing company has to learn that segmentation matters.</p>
<h2>Next Steps: Scaling and Optimization?</h2>
<p>Actually, no.</p>
<p>The initial email is triggered when new people subscribe. That part is easy.</p>
<p>The hard part is what to do with this information. For now, I&rsquo;m responding to each and every email. File that under <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">things that don&rsquo;t scale</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time-consuming process to send a meaningful responses to each person but so far, it&rsquo;s been a wonderful learning experience. The conversations often lead to specifics &ndash; blog posts that can solve their problems, frustrations with their current email tool and process, potential benefits of switching to Vero and so much more.</p>
<p>Marketers love to automate and optimize. The time will come for that. For now, we&rsquo;re just getting to know our readers and their pain points in a whole new way.</p>
<h2>A Few Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Be wary of false positives.</strong> As I mentioned before, we heard great feedback from some of the emails in our original campaign. That feedback didn&rsquo;t translate into revenue. Every business has one true metric. For us, it&rsquo;s signups. Everything else is a distraction.</li>
<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re going to ask for replies, use Help Scout.</strong> When we first started this, replies came directly to my inbox. This got messy fast. Now, we filter responses through Help Scout so we can share feedback and assign team members tasks as a result of these emails. (We are also working on adding response tracking to Vero. That will allow you to record responses as conversions if your campaign calls for it.)</li>
<li><strong>Understand the nuances of content marketing.</strong> When you build a community around content, people come for the content, not whatever you are using content to sell. You can never assume they want, care or even know about your product until they express that. Making the leap from education to activation is a monumental step for your customers. Don&rsquo;t take this challenge lightly. (Read <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/03/what-brand-babblers-dont-understand.html" target="_blank">What The Brand Babblers Don&rsquo;t Understand</a> for more on this.)</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t jump the gun.</strong> Marketers want to optimize everything. Everyone wants a growth hack. Spend the time to get to know your readers, not just infer things based on Google Analytics data.</li>
</ul><p>My gut is that building relationships with our readers early will greatly increase the likelihood of a signup later on. When we have enough data to update this post, we will. Until then, keep learning.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>You&rsquo;ve seen a lot of lists like this one.</p>
<p>Or have you?</p>
<p>The problem with lists like this is that they&rsquo;re repetitive &ndash; which means you don&rsquo;t learn anything new.</p>
<p>But we think this post will change that.</p>
<p>We set out to find 50 great marketing blogs &ndash; some you may have heard of but others that you probably haven&rsquo;t. There is gold in this list.</p>
<p>But first, a few notes:</p>
<ul><li>These aren&rsquo;t the 50 best marketing blogs of all time, just 50 really great ones. There are too many to choose from and I&rsquo;m sure we missed a few. (Be sure to let us know your top picks in the comments.)</li>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t take frequency into consideration. That means some of these blogs don&rsquo;t post often but when they do, pay attention.</li>
<li>We listed some additional &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; reads &ndash; blogs that we think all marketers should be following &ndash; at the bottom.</li>
<li>Are you interested in republishing this post? <a href="mailto:jimmy@getvero.com">Email us to chat.</a></li>
<li>Read <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/" target="_blank">last year&rsquo;s list here.</a></li>
<li>If the blog has an RSS feed, it&rsquo;s linked from the Feedly icon. You can also add these blogs <a href="http://feedly.com/jimmydaly/50%20Great%20Marketing%20Blogs">to your Feedly account here</a> or <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vero-marketing-blogs.opml_.zip" target="_blank">download an OPML file here</a>.</li>

</ul><p><strong>The Numbers (on the blog subdomain)</strong></p>
<ul><li>Pageviews: 69,184 (+6.57%)</li>
<li>Average time on site: 3:21 (+7.6%)</li>
<li>Bounce rate: 80.13% (+0.67%)</li>
<li>Organic search visits: 17,506 (+11.76%)</li>
<li>New email subscribers: 673</li>
</ul><p>We bumped into an issue with Google Tag Manager that result in five days of missing data. Our guides, which live in the /guides folder, weren&rsquo;t track by Google Analytics at all.</p>

<p>I (conservatively) estimate that we missed 5,731 pageviews, bringing the likely total to around 74,915. For the purposes of our reporting, I&rsquo;m only using the data in Google Analytics.</p>
<p><em>A big thanks to <a href="http://fullstackmarketer.com/">Casey Armstrong</a> for helping us diagnose the issue.</em></p>
<p>Organic traffic is still growing but we fell short of our 15% MoM goal.</p>

<h2>What Worked, What Flopped</h2>
<p>We don&rsquo;t often pull data from our own database for content marketing. This month, however, we published a smash hit based on <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">100 million emails Vero customers have actually sent</a>. The result was a ton of original data and a lot of interest from the email marketing community.</p>
<p>The feedback was great and we&rsquo;ll definitely plan to do this again in the future.</p>

<p>These ten counterintuitive email marketing lessons sum up nearly everything we believe (and know) about email. If this article makes you feel a little uneasy about your current strategy, good. That&rsquo;s the idea.</p>
<h2>1. Email isn&rsquo;t about selling.</h2>
<p>Do you watch TV for the commercials?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Do you check email for marketing newsletters?</p>
<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p><strong>Email isn&rsquo;t about selling. </strong>The primary reason people use email is to communicate with friends and co-workers. Secondarily, they use it to sign up for apps and services. (All social networks, for example, require an email address to create an account.) Receiving marketing materials is a side effect of using email for other reasons.</p>
<p>Despite all you&rsquo;ve heard about email as a channel, it&rsquo;s just a platform for communication. It&rsquo;s a great place to learn about what your leads and customers <em>want</em> and <em>need</em> but not necessarily the place to close deals.</p>
<p>Think about email as one piece of a multi-channel strategy where trust grows over time. Eventually, there is a tipping point but no single channel gets all the credit.</p>
<p>Aim for less noise:</p>

<h2>2. Email isn&rsquo;t that great at driving traffic.</h2>
<p>Since January 1, 2015, email has driven 12 percent of the total traffic to the Vero blog. Of that traffic, about 20 percent came from newsletters besides our own.</p>
<p>That accounts for nearly 50,000 visits. That&rsquo;s great but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the 130,000 organic search visits we&rsquo;ve earned over that same period.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wxoJJBmli6AfKGoBw6YG26tfE6eZNsKVY4Xh9phkHI/pubchart?oid=1901223879&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>If traffic is your primary goal, SEO has more potential than email. It scales faster and works for you 24/7.</p>
<p>Email does, however, drive targeted traffic. Because subscribers have opted-in to receive your emails, they are predisposed to like you and visit your site.</p>
<p>Our email traffic stays on the site for three minutes and one second on average, 67 percent longer than organic traffic (one minute and 48 seconds).</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wxoJJBmli6AfKGoBw6YG26tfE6eZNsKVY4Xh9phkHI/pubchart?oid=1918784050&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<p>What can we make of this data? SEO is a better source of new leads and email is better tool for nurturing relationships.</p>
<h2>3. Promotional email isn&rsquo;t a priority.</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the term <strong>email marketing</strong>?</p>
<p>Coupons? Sale this weekend? Another newsletter?</p>
<p>Email marketing is many things. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/promotional-emails/">Promotional email</a> is just one way it can be used to communicate with customers, subscribers, users and leads.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">analysis of 100 million emails</a>, we found that transactional emails have a click rate that is 42 percent higher than newsletters. For every 100 clicks you get on a newsletter, you get 142 on a transactional email.</p>

<p>We also talked about the email sweet spot &hellip; that perfect place where emails are expected, contextual, personalized and relevant (i.e. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a>).</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5841" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/email-marketing-sweet-spot-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=660%2C477&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="660,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email-marketing-sweet-spot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?fit=660%2C477&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5841" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png" alt="email-marketing-sweet-spot" width="660" height="477" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?w=660&amp;ssl=1 660w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=138%2C100&amp;ssl=1 138w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=50%2C36&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/email-marketing-sweet-spot1.png?resize=75%2C54&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></p>
<p>Lifecycle emails should be your first priority. Promotional emails, subject line testing, button color A/B tests &hellip; that&rsquo;s all fine <em>after</em> you&rsquo;ve laid a foundation of automated lifecycle emails.</p>
<p>If the graph above doesn&rsquo;t convince you, here&rsquo;s another way to think about it.</p>
<p>When you create a triggered lifecycle email, it works for you over and over again. Assuming your targeting is right, it arrives at the right time in the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/great-lifecycle-emails/">customer lifecycle</a> every time.</p>
<p>Compare that to promotional emails, which need to be created over and over again. And even if you segment your lists, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to send the right offer to every single person. It&rsquo;s essentially just guessing.</p>
<h2>4. Replies are a huge win.</h2>
<p>One conversion metric you might not be measuring is replies.</p>
<p>Here are two important things to think about:</p>
<p>First, people are likely already responding to your emails. If you aren&rsquo;t checking those responses, track them down. If you send a weekly newsletter to thousands of people, there is intel in those responses that can help you close leads and improve your content.</p>
<p>At Vero, we filter responses to our newsletter through <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/" target="_blank">Help Scout</a> so that we can assign the right team member to handle each one. Most responses are &ldquo;Out of Office&rdquo; replies but each week, we find a few people who need help getting started with Vero or have ideas for improving the newsletter.</p>

<p>Second, you can simply ask people to reply to your emails. Here&rsquo;s an example of an email we automate when new users start their first campaign:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5843" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/vero-ask-people-to-reply/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?fit=655%2C296&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="655,296" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="vero ask people to reply" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?fit=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?fit=655%2C296&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5843" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg" alt="vero ask people to reply" width="655" height="296" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=300%2C136&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=221%2C100&amp;ssl=1 221w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=50%2C23&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vero-ask-people-to-reply.jpg?resize=75%2C34&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px"></p>
<p>Whatever you do, never send email from an address like &ldquo;noreply@business.com&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a surefire way to let your subscribers know it&rsquo;s a one-way conversation.</p>
<h2>5. You don&rsquo;t need to spend a fortune.</h2>
<p>We recently published case studies about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">TripAdvisor</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon&rsquo;s email marketing strategy</a>. As you might imagine, these companies are highly sophisticated and totally automated.</p>
<p>We got a lot of great feedback on those posts but one comment we heard over and over again was, &ldquo;Those are huge companies with massive marketing budgets. How can I send emails like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two comments on this point:</p>
<p>First, anyone can send triggered, personalized emails. Software like Vero starts at $99/month and has all the power you need to send emails like TripAdvisor and Amazon.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/features/">Check out our features over here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Second, you don&rsquo;t build an email program like Amazon&rsquo;s overnight. It takes time. When people ask us where to start, our answer is always the same &ndash; at the beginning.</p>
<p>Onboarding is a great place to kick things off since you can get an ROI so quickly. In order, your first three triggered emails should be:</p>
<h3>1. <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-emails/">A great welcome email to set the tone</a></h3>

<p>Before you know it, you&rsquo;ll have an automated email system working 24/7.</p>
<h2>6. Subject lines don&rsquo;t drive opens.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a common myth that the subject line is what gets an email opened.</p>
<p>Sure, it factors in but <strong>emails get opened because of the rapport established between the sender and the recipient</strong>. <a href="http://ctt.ec/2VCkf" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<p>Take Alexis Madrigal&rsquo;s newsletter as an example. You won&rsquo;t find a lot of flash in his subject lines. That&rsquo;s because it isn&rsquo;t necessary. People subscribe to and open his newsletter because he sends it. They trust him. Readers like it, so they open the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Trust is scalable.</strong> <em><a href="http://ctt.ec/C9f5B" target="_blank">Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</a></em></p>

<p>Instead of asking, &ldquo;How can I get more people to open my emails?&rdquo; ask, &ldquo;How can I earn more trust?&rdquo; <a href="http://ctt.ec/Ke5V6" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this&ndash;&gt;</em></a></p>
<h2>7. Design is less important than you think.</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of talk about sending beautiful, mobile-responsive emails. That&rsquo;s super important <em>if</em> you&rsquo;re sending HTML emails. Most of our best performing email campaigns are rich text. It&rsquo;s the perfect middle ground between plain text and HTML.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="608px"><img data-attachment-id="5849" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/rich-text-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=608%2C379&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="608,379" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rich text email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?fit=608%2C379&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5849" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png" alt="rich text email" width="608" height="379" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?w=608&amp;ssl=1 608w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=300%2C187&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=160%2C100&amp;ssl=1 160w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=50%2C31&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rich-text-email.png?resize=75%2C47&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px"></p>
<p>One problem with HTML emails is that there is too much emphasis on design. Rich text emails help you focus on writing for audience of one. <a href="http://ctt.ec/BO1j7" target="_blank"><em>Tweet this &ndash;&gt;</em></a><em> (This is the single most important email copywriting tactic!)</em></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from our friend <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-templates-hurt-business/">Nathan Barry</a> on the topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best way to market online is to teach, to regularly deliver valuable content to your audience so that they will trust you and eventually want to purchase from you. So when you send an email, what part of the communication delivers the most value?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the content. <strong>So we should be stripping away everything else that isn&rsquo;t necessary in order to focus on the content.</strong> Multi-column layouts, background images, logos, and all the other nonsense that typically fills marketing emails doesn&rsquo;t deliver value to the recipient. Instead it is all about you, the sender. Flip that around and start delivering value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rich text emails can leverage some design, like buttons. A simple email with a bold button is a sweet spot for design. If you are looking for a quick way to increase click-through rates, this is a tactic you should try.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, rich text emails are mobile-friendly by default.</p>

<h2>8. Don&rsquo;t send emails on holidays or weekends.</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a <em>good idea</em> to send timely emails but it&rsquo;s a <em>bad idea</em> to send emails when people don&rsquo;t want to hear from you.</p>
<p>Think about your favorite holiday, maybe it&rsquo;s Thanksgiving. It&rsquo;s a day for family and friends, not email. The truth is that your brand isn&rsquo;t important enough in your customers&rsquo; lives to email them on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>A note that says &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so thankful to have you as a customer&rdquo; takes away from their holiday. It&rsquo;s not timely, it&rsquo;s tacky.</p>
<p>The same goes for weekends. Even though <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/">data will tell you open rates are steady over the weekend</a>, have some respect for down time. No one wants your email when they are trying to get away from screens for 48 hours to spend time with their family.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a timely email. Apple just announced a new MacBook and this email is being sent existing Gazelle customers. The context is built-in.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5851" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/counterintuitive-advice/gazelle-time-sensitive-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?fit=713%2C552&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="713,552" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gazelle time sensitive email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?fit=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?fit=713%2C552&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5851" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg" alt="gazelle time sensitive email" width="713" height="552" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?w=713&amp;ssl=1 713w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?resize=129%2C100&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/gazelle-time-sensitive-email.jpg?resize=75%2C58&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px"></p>

<p>Understand the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I received a <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/happy-birthday-email.jpg" target="_blank">&ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; email</a> from my student loan lender &hellip; the <strong>last</strong> people I want to hear from on my birthday. This fits perfectly into <a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2015/03/what-brand-babblers-dont-understand.html" target="_blank">Bob Hoffman&rsquo;s brand babble</a> scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having a successful brand is very important to a marketer. But the idea that it is anything like that to a consumer is folly. Brand babble is just the faulty conflation of marketers&rsquo; needs and consumers&rsquo; interests.</p></blockquote>
<h2>9. The bigger the list, the worse the emails.</h2>
<p>So you have 100,000 people on your list? That&rsquo;s great, <em>unless</em> you are sending the same email to every single one.</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Each of those 100,000 people has their own budget and their own buying motivations. Each is in a different place in the customer lifecycle. <strong>Sending the same message to all of them is a wasted opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>As the size of the list grows, so does the variety of people on it. Eventually, you are just targeting the &ldquo;average&rdquo; buyer and leaving out the majority of the people on the list. That&rsquo;s no way to build trust. You are the noise.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, you would send each of those 100,000 people a unique email. That&rsquo;s hard to do unless you automate the process.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid sending watered-down emails use external attributes to send super-personalized emails.</p>
<p><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/external-attributes/" target="_blank">See how Vero allows you to do this.</a></p>
<p>Check out this <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/" target="_blank">email from Airbnb</a>. We&rsquo;ve referred to it as the perfect behavioral email but it&rsquo;s actually not very hard to send.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi {First.name},</p>
<p>[insert data from browsing history]</p>
<p>[insert call to action]</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not the right fit, here are some other options.</p>
<p>[insert other listings in the same area and price range]</p></blockquote>
<p>Once the framework for an email like this is built, it can be automatically triggered over and over again. On a popular site like Airbnb, 100,000 emails might be triggered in just a few days. And each one is personalized, contextual and highly targeted.</p>
<p>Notice there is little reliance on design, copy or subject lines. It&rsquo;s <strong>all</strong> about context.</p>
<p>There is one important caveat to this. If people opt-in to a newsletter and that&rsquo;s all they receive, you can grow trust and audience simultaneously. Take Moz, for example, who send a bimonthly newsletter called the <a href="http://moz.com/moztop10" target="_blank">Moz Top 10</a>.</p>

<p>This works because the emphasis is on community and knowledge sharing. Moz is selling trust, not products.</p>
<h2>10. You can email people every day &hellip;</h2>
<p>&hellip; if they are expecting it.</p>
<p>Frequency is entirely dependent on the expectation the sender has set with the recipients. Digg, for example, offers an email every day so that&rsquo;s exactly what they deliver.</p>

<p>To be fair, many companies haven&rsquo;t set an expectation. So how often should they send emails?</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/100-million-emails/" target="_blank">massive analysis</a>, we found that e-commerce businesses actually get more clicks on the second email of the week.</p>
<blockquote><p>We found that e-commerce businesses generally fared better when they sent multiple emails per week. One particularly high lift was the difference between one and two emails a week. On average, e-commerce customers saw an average click rate of 7.8% if they sent one email per week, while those that sent two saw an increase of 27% with an average click rate of 9.94%.</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting. But don&rsquo;t let the data guide you down the wrong path. More is not always better, <em>even if the numbers initially indicate it</em>.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the recipients&rsquo; shoes. Do you really want 2-3 emails per week from one company? It&rsquo;s likely that a temporary increase in frequency will net you more conversions in the short term but it&rsquo;s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Be careful not to falsely conclude that more is better. When it comes to frequency, it&rsquo;s better to earn and maintain trust rather than cannibalize your list.</p>
<hr><p>Were those tips counterintuitive enough? If you have another one, we want to hear it. Drop a note in the comments.</p>

<html><body><p>The biggest challenge in content marketing is the one we rarely talk about.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not content creation, promotion, pageviews, social shares or link building. Those are all just means to an end.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s conversion.</strong></p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s goes deeper than that. <strong>Content marketing&rsquo;s biggest challenge is bridging the gap from education to a practical solution (i.e. your product).</strong></p>
<p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll look at few companies who are bridge-building masters, then dive into how we&rsquo;re trying to solve this problem at Vero.</p>
<h2>Feedly: Creating Supply <em>and</em> Demand</h2>
<p>Feedly recently launched a new feature called <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/2014/10/03/collection-sharing/" target="_blank">Collection Sharing</a>. Users can create a public profile where they can share collections of RSS feeds. It&rsquo;s a cool social tool and a fun way to share RSS feeds (much easier than OPML files) but, at it&rsquo;s core, this is a conversion strategy.</p>
<p>Check out how it works.</p>
<p>First, I create a <a href="http://feedly.com/jimmydaly" target="_blank">public page</a>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5358" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/education-to-activation/jimmy-feedly-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?fit=800%2C394&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,394" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="jimmy feedly" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?fit=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?fit=800%2C394&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5358" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png" alt="jimmy feedly" width="800" height="394" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?resize=300%2C148&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?resize=203%2C100&amp;ssl=1 203w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?resize=50%2C25&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jimmy-feedly1.png?resize=75%2C37&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Then, people can add the blogs I follow directly to their own Feedly account. If they don&rsquo;t have a Feedly account, they are prompted to create one, then the blogs are added.</p>

<p>Feedly has bridged the gap between marketing and activation. Collection Sharing creates a need for the product, which they can immediately satisfy.</p>
<p><em>This might seem simple but this is incredibly smart marketing. Don&rsquo;t overlook the massive value of building bridges.</em></p>
<h2>Copyblogger: A Tiered Conversion Strategy</h2>
<p>Copyblogger also does a great job bridging the gap. They draw readers in with their content. Then, they begin a tiered conversion process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Reference their products in the content.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout Copyblogger&rsquo;s blog, you&rsquo;ll find links to their membership site and paid products. The links in this screenshot lead to a login prompt &ndash; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to create an account to view that!&rdquo; &ndash; and a landing page, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Offer more content in exchange for an email address.</strong></p>
<p>Copyblogger uses a membership site called <a href="http://my.copyblogger.com/">MyCopyblogger</a> to deliver e-books, courses, webinars and more.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Sell the pickaxes and blue jeans.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to <a href="http://blog.urx.com/urx-blog/when-there-is-a-gold-rush-start-selling-pick-axes-and">cash in on a gold rush</a>, you can either mine for gold or sell pickaxes and blue jeans.</p>
<p>Copyblogger sells pickaxes and blue jeans &ndash; hosting, SEO tools, analytics, a CMS and, of course, education to help you maximize all those tools.</p>
<p>Their content creates a demand for the very tools they sell. The handoff is practical and useful. When it comes time to ask for the conversion, the bridge has already been built.</p>
<h2>Evernote: The Art of Being Everywhere</h2>
<p>Evernote does this as well as, and maybe better than, just about anyone.</p>
<p>They have a unique challenge in that their product solves <em>so many problems</em>. Their growth strategy has been to 1) integrate with everyone and everything and 2) make it dead-simple to signup for an account.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one example of an Evernote gateway.</p>
<p>When I share a notebook &ndash; say, for example, our <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/runjimdaly/lifecycleemailswipefile" target="_blank">Lifecycle Email Swipe File</a> &ndash; Evernote prompts the viewer to add the content to their own Evernote account. And if they don&rsquo;t have an account, they can quickly create one to save the content.</p>
<p>Evernote is both the demand and the supply.</p>

<p>Evernote has managed to build <strong>many</strong> bridges, each with a logical transition from problem to solution.</p>
<h2>IFTTT: If You Like This, Then Signup</h2>
<p>IFTTT&rsquo;s <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/hot" target="_blank">library of &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;</a> is similar to the approach we&rsquo;re taking at Vero (more on that below).</p>
<p>The idea is simple.</p>
<p>IFTTT has created a massive library of recipes that users can search through. It shows off the product&rsquo;s impressive capabilities and makes it very easy to get started. The recipe library serves as an activation gateway. From each page, users can add recipes to their own account or signup.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="485px"><img data-attachment-id="5365" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/education-to-activation/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?fit=485%2C630&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="485,630" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ifttt recipe dad jokes" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?fit=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?fit=485%2C630&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5365" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png" alt="ifttt recipe dad jokes" width="485" height="630" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?w=485&amp;ssl=1 485w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?resize=231%2C300&amp;ssl=1 231w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?resize=77%2C100&amp;ssl=1 77w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ifttt-recipe-dad-jokes.png?resize=58%2C75&amp;ssl=1 58w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px"></p>
<p>The recipes are easily accessible to existing users also. So in addition to helping acquire new users, this resource engages existing ones as well. By sending out new recipes in a newsletter, their emails become lifecycle emails, retention emails and promotional emails all at the same time. Super smart.</p>

<h2>How Vero Is Building Bridges</h2>
<p>At Vero, we have a fast-growing blog where we share email marketing ideas, insight and tons of examples. The challenge is helping our readers actually implement those ideas.</p>
<p>For Feedly users, it&rsquo;s as simple as creating an account and adding feeds. But setting up an email campaign is more complex, especially when dealing with <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/convert-with-behavioral-email/">behavioral email</a>. (It&rsquo;s not rocket science but it takes a bit of time to do it right.)</p>
<p>We are bridging the &ldquo;education to activation&rdquo; gap with a new initiative we&rsquo;re calling the <strong><a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/idea-lab/">Idea Lab</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/idea-lab/">Idea Lab</a>, readers can browse through proven email campaigns, then actually send them with Vero. For existing customers, the campaigns will be copied into their account (including triggers) where they can be tweaked and sent.</p>

<html><body><p>The cost of college textbooks has risen 812 percent since 1978. That&rsquo;s more than <em>triple</em> the inflation rate over the same period of time, according to <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/why-are-college-textbooks-so-absurdly-expensive/266801/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></em>.</p>
<p>So what gives?</p>
<p>Textbook costs are a perfect example of an economic theory known as the <a href="http://tap.usf.edu/news/the-somebody-elses-money-problem-npr-explores-the-rise-in-college-textbook-costs/" target="_blank">principal-agent problem</a>. Professors (the agent) choose the textbooks and the students (the principal) pay for them.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/03/353300404/episode-573-why-textbook-prices-keep-climbing" target="_blank">Planet Money</a> said, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;the somebody else&rsquo;s money problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marketing has a problem of its own that can partially be attributed to the principal-agent problem. Content, email and SEO have all reached critical mass. <em>Everyone is doing it.</em> And that has created a real issue: mediocrity.</p>
<p>Nearly all marketing looks and feels the same. Hardly anything stands out. Every blog churns out general, obvious information. Email marketers send cookie-cutter templates on Tuesdays at 10am. And SEO&rsquo;s have <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator" target="_blank">title generating tools</a> to create headlines that &ldquo;speak to Google <em>and</em> the reader.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Marketing has a &ldquo;somebody else&rsquo;s money problem.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Marketers (the agents) are working for managers and clients while the customers (the principals) are left without sources of good information. The marketers should be working for the customers in the same way professors should be working for their students. Self-interest gets in the way and principals are left out to dry.</p>
<p>Look around at businesses doing the best marketing. <strong>They are doing things that don&rsquo;t scale.</strong> They share information that&rsquo;s actually interesting and educational. They treat people with kindness and respect.</p>
<p>And they <em>always</em> remember that the customer comes first.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>2014 was a big year for the Vero blog.</p>
<p>We learned a lot. A few of our posts were <strong>big</strong> hits and a few fell flat.</p>
<p>Below, you&rsquo;ll find links to all 104 posts we published this year along with the total numbers of pageviews (as of December 15). If you have any thoughts about why some killed it and some flopped, feel free to leave a comment &hellip; we&rsquo;d be curious on your take.</p>
<h2>What We Learned in 2015</h2>
<h2>1. Bigger is (sometimes) better.</h2>
<p>Four posts had more than 10,000 pageviews and each was greater than 2,000 words. In fact, our most popular post of the year was over 10,000 words. We&rsquo;re not suggesting using more words than you need to but know that people will read longer posts if they are informative.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-guide/">The Ultimate Guide to Successful Email Marketing</a>, which racked up more than 46,000 pageviews.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4998" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/2014-lessons-learned/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?fit=800%2C477&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="the ultimate guide to email marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?fit=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?fit=800%2C477&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4998" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png" alt="the ultimate guide to email marketing" width="800" height="477" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?resize=168%2C100&amp;ssl=1 168w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-ultimate-guide-to-email-marketing.png?resize=75%2C45&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h3>2. Invest in design.</h3>
<p>We put some real effort into making our posts look great this year. We did this to enhance readability but also to let people know we&rsquo;re serious about creating great content.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://draftin.com:443/images/25316?token=2Vwu0SuutVEpDf_4NocTqlyhMD_kneSj7owSLVYFfaaT3xPHmfrtBuDy4qYwM_FUVoKMFRGKTOAgzGCvFlGXFbU" alt="design is SEO.png"></p>
<p>Check out these posts in particular:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">How Amazon Dominates E-Commerce with Email Marketing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">20 Tips for Dramatically Better Emails</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/">The Complete Guide to Transactional Email</a></li>
</ul><p>Also, user experience is SEO. Which leads us to the next point &hellip;</p>
<h3>3. Don&rsquo;t screw around with SEO.</h3>
<p>In August, we launched a redesign of the blog. As part of the process, we changed a few URLs and added a splash page in place of the normal homepage.</p>
<p>DOH!</p>
<p>That cost us 22 percent of our organic search traffic and we&rsquo;re still recovering four months later.</p>
<h3>4. Link building is king.</h3>
<p>We invested serious time in link building this year. I&rsquo;m not talking about directories and forums. I&rsquo;m talking about old-school networking. And that led to some seriously awesome links. Here are a few of the best links we earned this year:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/can-email-be-responsive">Can Email Be Responsive?</a> via <em>A List Apart</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/10-tricks-to-write-radically-better-emails.html">10 Tricks to Write Radically Better Emails</a> via <em>Inc</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240288">20 Must-Reads for Aspiring Entrepreneurs</a> via <em>Entrepreneur</em></li>
<li><a href="http://betabeat.com/2014/11/from-zero-to-35000-how-i-built-an-big-email-list-exclusively-about-books-i-liked/">From Zero to 35,000: How I Built A Big Email List Exclusively About Books I Liked</a> via <em>BetaBeat</em></li>
</ul><h3>5. Make friends.</h3>
<p>This might seem silly but you can&rsquo;t grow a blog alone. We got to know some people this year that really helped us. Sometimes that meant sharing our content but other times it meant giving us really honest (and sometimes brutal) feedback.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t give you a formula for this but, in general, act like a human being and an upstanding citizen of the Internet. It goes a long way.</p>
<h3>6. Create a swipe file.</h3>
<p>We live and breathe the swipe file. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/improve-your-email-marketing-today/">More on how to create one here.</a>)</p>
<p>I get more email than just about anyone on Earth. That&rsquo;s because I sign up for every newsletter and product possible to see what kind of emails they send me. I tag the ones that stand out then use them as examples in on the blog.</p>
<p>This has not only saved a <strong>ton</strong> of time but it allows us to create content with unique examples every time. We took this process to the extreme with our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon Email Experience</a> post where we signed up for an account and bought things just to see what emails we&rsquo;d get.</p>
<p>We also published a few swipe files that people can download. Find those <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-emails/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>7. Be really transparent.</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go as far as publishing employee salaries but a little transparency goes a long way.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/epic-post-breakdown/">this post</a> where we explained <em>exactly</em> how we promoted our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">best practices guide</a>.</p>
<p>That post racked up 38 comments, nearly 4,000 pageviews and more than 1,200 shares. The knowledge we shared was a byproduct of our other marketing efforts. (Thanks to <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products">Jason Fried</a> and <a href="http://backlinko.com/">Brian Dean</a> for the inspiration.)</p>
<h3>8. Try new things, even if you&rsquo;re afraid they might fail.</h3>
<p>Outside of writing blog posts, we tried a few other things:</p>
<ul><li>Hosted <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/chexton/email-marketing-tips-how-to-growth-hack-the-inbox" target="_blank">webinars</a></li>
<li>Had a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-q-and-a/">live Q&amp;A calls</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/holiday-email-marketing/">Published an email course</a></li>
<li>Guest posted (on <a href="http://marketingland.com/author/jimmy-daly">MarketingLand</a>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/3-ways-send-behavioral-emails/">SendGrid</a>, <a href="http://blog.lemonstand.com/email-marketing-for-ecommerce/">LemonStand</a>, <a href="http://unbounce.com/email-marketing/4-ways-to-turn-boring-transactional-emails-into-cash/">Unbounce</a>, <a href="http://boostblogtraffic.com/minimalist-twitter/">Boost Blog Traffic</a> and a few others)</li>
<li>Wrote a weekly roundup (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/must-read-email-marketing-articles/">we combined all of them here</a>)</li>
<li>Interviewed smart people (like Buffer&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/meet-courtney-seiter/">Courtney Seiter</a>, Moz&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/meet-erica-mcgillivray/">Erica McGillivray</a> and Mack Web&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-and-community-building/">Mackenzie Fogelson</a>)</li>
</ul><p>Some of these kicked ass, others stunk it up. We learned a few key lessons that will help guide our marketing next year.</p>
<h3>9. Get real with your data.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get stuck in an analytics rut. Fight your way out &hellip; it&rsquo;s so worth it!</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time this year getting our Google Analytics data in order. Now we have a much better handle on where newsletter subscribers and free trials convert and how they find us. It&rsquo;s been an enlightening process.</p>
<p>We also spent a lot of time in Excel mucking around with data. For 6 months, I kept track of the number of words in each blog post to see what our readers responded to. Chris and I also collaborated on a new way to <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/measure-email-marketing-campaigns/">visualize email campaign data</a>.</p>
<p>It was time well spent. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/measure-email-marketing-campaigns/">Read more about that here.</a>)</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnaIcFqem7KDieh-2f0QjZvmU75CtglN5eZvOtAmtyA/pubchart?oid=662452951&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
<h3>10. Surround yourself with inspiring people.</h3>
<p>When you work remotely, it can be difficult to physically surround yourself with people. As motivational speaker Jim Rohn <a href="http://blog.clarity.fm/you-are-the-average-of-these-5-people/">famously said</a>, &ldquo;You are the average of the five people that you spend the most time with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I work with my dog mostly. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/wp1Gg6pP_M/">She&rsquo;s great</a> but Rohn did specify <em>people</em>. So in addition to my co-workers, I make an effort to read a lot of inspiring articles and books. These people bring my average up.</p>

<li>Seth Godin: <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth&rsquo;s Blog</a>, <a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp">a bunch of books</a></li>

</ol><p>So, with all that said, here is all the content we published in 2014. Thanks for making it a great year, and here&rsquo;s to an even better 2015.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>As Steve Jobs once said, <strong>&ldquo;Real artists ship.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>To make content marketing work, writers need to be shipping great content on a regular basis. Having the right tools is key to maximizing productivity. The best writers find ways to keep the focus on writing while also finding ways to highlight and reference work from other content creators to help build relationships and amplify distribution (making the content you create work harder for you).</p>
<p>This list will focus specifically on tools that will help make your research and content creation workflow simpler and faster For more on content promotion, check out <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-promotion/" target="_blank">13 Steps to Take Your Content Promotion to the Next Level</a>.</p>
<h2>Research, Reading and Discovery Tools</h2>
<p>The first step to creating great content is understanding the industry and the audience you are writing for. The tools below will help you get plugged-in to the best content, discover new sites, and connect with the best bloggers in your vertical.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a> &ndash; In the wake of the Google Reader shutdown, Feedly has emerged as the best way to subscribe the RSS feeds. RSS is still one of the best ways to monitor your industry for news and content. Feedly&rsquo;s mobile apps and UI make this a better replacement for your old Google Reader. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of RSS feeds.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> &ndash; You never knew how badly you needed Instapaper until you&rsquo;ve tried it. It&rsquo;s a great way to save articles for offline reading. It also cleans up saved articles to minimize distractions. Set it up on all of your devices to collect content for later.</li>
<li><a href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> &ndash; This is basically the same thing as Instapaper and an equally great product.</li>
<li><a href="http://getprismatic.com/" target="_blank">Prismatic</a> &ndash; One of my favorite ways to &ldquo;unearth&rdquo; new content. Subscribe to just about any blog or category to find new and useful information.</li>
<li><a href="http://digg.com/" target="_blank">Digg</a> &ndash; Digg is back, baby! The new Digg is a highly-curated feed of &ldquo;the most interesting and talked about stories on the Internet right now.&rdquo; The daily email newsletter is also a must-read.</li>
<li><a href="http://fre.sh/" target="_blank">Fre.sh</a> &ndash; Created by BuzzFeed, Fre.sh is constantly updated feed of the 50 most popular stories on the web. Not surprisingly, most of the links send readers to BuzzFeed stories but there are links to great across the web.</li>
<li><a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> &ndash; Their tagline, &ldquo;Put the internet to work for you,&rdquo; is pretty accurate. Connecting different sites and services is a powerful way to automate your workflow. For example, automatically save new Cornerstone Content articles to your Pocket account or feed content you&rsquo;ve written to Buffer. According to The Verge, the owners wants to &ldquo;open up IFTTT as a platform and let anyone make a channel&rdquo; meaning writers and publishers should be paying close attention.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank">Google Trends</a> &ndash; Track the popularity of keywords in Google Search over time. This is a simple but powerful way to see what people are interested in. The graphs can also be used as visual objects in your own content.</li>
</ul><h2>Content Creation and Curation Tools</h2>
<p>Content needs to be more than text to maximize social sharing. Here are few tools to help content creators add engaging, social objects to any article.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://timeline.verite.co/" target="_blank">Timeline JS</a> &ndash; Create embeddable, responsive timelines. Using Google Spreadsheets, Timeline JS allows you to build rich timelines that include videos, photos and tweets. <a href="http://timeline.verite.co/examples/user-interface/" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.thinglink.com/" target="_blank">ThingLink</a> &ndash; This is an easy way to make images interactive. Upload an image, tag it, then embed it on your site. <a href="http://www.thinglink.com/scene/429660314208829441" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://piktochart.com/" target="_blank">Piktochart</a> &ndash; Infographics are awesome tools for displaying data-driven content but hard to create from scratch. Piktochart uses template and drag-and-drop tools to make the process much easier. <a href="http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2012/09/8-reasons-why-government-adopting-video-conferencing-infographic" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://infogr.am/" target="_blank">Infogr.am</a> &ndash; Another tool for creating infographics but this one works best with spreadsheets of data. <a href="http://infogr.am/Whats-in-an-NBA-draft-pick" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://storify.com/" target="_blank">Storify</a> &ndash; Curating tweets, Instagram posts and YouTube videos is a quick and easy way to cover breaking news and cover an event. Storify makes this simple and allows users to embed their work on their own sites. <a href="https://storify.com/weatherchannel/fire-blazes-through-seaside-park-n-j-boardwalk" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wordle.net/" target="_blank">Wordle</a> &ndash; Word clouds are a cool way to add context to a presentation, like the State of the Union and an iPhone launch. Visual elements like this make content infinitely more shareable. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/02/12/spending-question-looms-large-in-obamas-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://polldaddy.com/" target="_blank">Polldaddy</a> &ndash; Surveys and quizzes are another way to make content interactive and interesting. One idea: Create trivia questions about old content to breath new life old posts. <a href="http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2013/08/10-questions-test-your-federal-data-center-knowledge-quiz" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory" target="_blank">Google Public Data</a> &ndash; There is an insane amount of data here and Google has made it all very easy to navigate and share. <a href="http://www.ucsb-efp.com/index.php/2013/08/16/google-public-data-explorer/" target="_blank">See an example.</a></li>
</ul><h2>Content Production Tools</h2>
<p>Here are a few tools to help content creators hack their productivity.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://mouapp.com/" target="_blank">Mou</a> &ndash; Stop writing web articles in Microsoft Word. Markdown is a basic text-to-HTML conversion tool that makes writing for the web easier. Mou is the best app for writing in Markdown, loaded with keyboard shortcuts, live previews and custom CSS.</li>
<li><a href="https://Penflip.com/" target="_blank">Penflip</a> &ndash; A great tool for cloud-based markdown collaboration. This tool makes it incredibly easy to share drafts and publish when it&rsquo;s done.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/" target="_blank">Pixelmator</a> &ndash; Every content creator should have basic image-editing skills but Photoshop is overkill. Pixelmator is Photoshop&rsquo;s little brother and at just $15, it&rsquo;s an amazing image editor.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudup.com/" target="_blank">Cloudup</a> &ndash; This is an easy way to share images, files and especially screenshots. If you ever publish screenshots, this little app will save you time (and storage space).</li>
<li><a href="http://download.cnet.com/ClipBoard-Cleaner/3000-2384_4-10417573.html" target="_blank">Clipboard Cleaner</a> &ndash; Removes formatting from your clipboard so you easily move text without styling. It&rsquo;s a lifesaver for web writers (especially if you are using Microsoft Word).</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cloud-clip/id552367503?mt=12" target="_blank">Cloud Clip</a> &ndash; This nifty app saves your clipboard history in case you need to access it later.</li>
</ul><h2>Other Awesome Content Marketing Tool Lists</h2>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the only great list out there. Here are few others that you should bookmark.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://moz.com/blog/100-free-seo-tools" target="_blank">Moz&rsquo;s 100 Best Free SEO Tools</a> &ndash; Good luck making it through this entire list in one sitting. It&rsquo;s an awesome resource.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?pli=1&amp;key=0AlgVNSddFpwxdE9rbUZzVEVock5tODFOVWVqellWaWc&amp;f=true&amp;noheader=true&amp;gid=12" target="_blank">Annie Cushing&rsquo;s Must-Have Tools</a> &ndash; This Google Doc is loaded with tools for SEO, analytics, data visualization and a lot more. It&rsquo;s one of the best resources ever created for content producers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inbound.org/articles?query=tool" target="_blank">Inbound.org&rsquo;s Tools</a> &ndash; A crowdsourced, constantly evolving list of awesome inbound marketing tools.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/50-content-marketing-tools/" target="_blank">50 Content Marketing Tools</a> &ndash; A nice list from the KISSMetrics blog.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.curata.com/blog/content-marketing-tools-ultimate-list/" target="_blank">Curata&rsquo;s List of Content Tools</a> &ndash; Curata does a nice job of listing and segmenting several content tools in their list.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.contentharmony.com/tools/" target="_blank">Recommended Content Tools from Content Harmony</a> &ndash; This is a shorter list of tools that content marketing agency Content Harmony uses and recommends.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.contentmarketingexperience.com/2013/content-marketing-software-categorization-and-tips-to-select-a-vendor/" target="_blank">Content Marketing Experience&rsquo;s List of Content Marketing Software Options</a> &ndash; This list skews more towards enterprise software tool options and lists some platforms not covered in-depth by the other resources listed here.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.cornerstonecontent.com/13-steps-to-take-your-content-promotion-to-the-next-level/" target="_blank">Cornerstone Content</a>. I wrote it in my tech blogging days but all the lessons here apply directly to marketers. Given the interest in our recent <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/epic-post-breakdown/" target="_blank">post about link building and promotion</a>, I thought this would be the perfect time to spend more time on this topic. Enjoy!</em></p>
<p>Content promotion is an art. It requires strategy, time and, most importantly, people. In order to grow an audience and attract attention, your posts &ndash; no matter how great they are &ndash; need to be effectively promoted on social media, with email marketing and in real life. Here is a look at how to take your content promotion to the next level.</p>
<h2>1. Start with relationships.</h2>
<p>If your promotion starts with broadcasting, you are starting in the wrong place. We all want our content to attract attention but the seed of a great post lies in its value to others, not it your ability to make noise on social media.</p>
<p>Take a hard look at your current audience and the readers you are trying to reach. If they aren&rsquo;t reading your work, whose work are they reading? <strong>Find out.</strong> One of the most powerful assets a blogger has is their network of other bloggers in a niche. It&rsquo;s time to build that network.</p>
<p>Here are a few really specific ways to network with your peers. It&rsquo;s the first step in massively growing your audience:</p>
<ul><li>Comment on their blogs.</li>
<li>Include their work in roundup posts.</li>
<li>Send them an email to ask a thoughtful question.</li>
<li>Follow them on Twitter, Facebook and Google+.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t patronize them.</strong> Simply let them know you like their work. Make sure there are links to your own work in your email signature and social media profiles so that it can be easily discovered when you contact people.</li>
</ul><h2>2. Plan your topics strategically.</h2>
<p>Think about promotion before you ever write a word. Depending on the topic, you can identify platforms or groups of people that might like your work. For example, content about technology might get traffic from a Hacker News submission while a post about holiday decorations will play better on Pinterest. Every vertical has websites, social networks and message boards that cater to readers. Examine them. Think about the topics that frequently succeed in your niche and follow their example (and network with the bloggers that write them).</p>
<h2>3. Choose the right format.</h2>
<p>Should you go with a listicle or a case study? A Q&amp;A or a column? There are so many ways to shape your content that it can lead to &ldquo;analysis paralysis.&rdquo; First, take a look at these <a href="http://www.tryinteract.com/blog/72-blog-post-ideas-to-energize-your-content/">72 content types</a> and see what feels right. You may also want to align the format of the content with other successful pieces.</p>
<h2>4. Shape your content accordingly.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>. I know that articles featured on Digg get thousands of hits. Here&rsquo;s a quick look at how I got one of my articles featured on the site by writing it specifically for the platform.</p>
<p>The Digg editors appreciate timeliness, thought-leadership, cultural relevance and longform content. (I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t part of their editorial guidelines, just my observation.)</p>
<p>I took a look at my vertical: technology. Were there any timely events coming up that might interest a wider audience? (In technology, there&rsquo;s <em>always</em> an interesting event coming up.) In this case, Internet Explorer&rsquo;s 18th birthday was just around the corner. I put together a <a href="http://www.statetechmagazine.com/article/2013/08/visual-history-internet-explorer" target="_blank">visual history of Internet Explorer</a> and submitted it to Digg the morning of the event.</p>
<p>It was featured on the Digg homepage that day and shared on their Facebook and Twitter channels. It delivered an enormous amount of traffic and social shares. And it happened because our team was strategic and prepared.</p>

<p>Not every piece of content is right for a mainstream platform like Digg but every piece you write should be worthy of a link, a share or a discussion in a message board. Here&rsquo;s a few tips to increase the likelihood that people will help you promote your content:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quote smart people.</strong> It provides value to your reader but also gives the quoted person a vested interested in your post. You can take it to the next level by interviewing a leader in your vertical.</li>
<li><strong>Link to external resources.</strong> &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all ships.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t be afraid to link to your competitors&rsquo; content if it provides value to a reader. Let them know about the link you gave them and ask them to share the content.</li>
<li><strong>Use visual aids.</strong> Learn how to use Photoshop, Pixelmator or another image editing tool. Even the simplest visuals are proven to help your content gain traction on sites like Pinterest and Twitter.</li>
</ul><h2>5. Focus on quality and value.</h2>
<p>In other words, forget about SEO until <em>after</em> your intelligent, insightful, share-able post is written. Too often content creators fall prey to SEO&rsquo;s tempting shortcuts. <strong>Stay strong.</strong> And more importantly, stay laser-focused on creating content that delivers value to your readers. Content written for SEO has a funny habit of failing miserably. <strong>Write, edit, edit again, <em>then</em> optimize for search.</strong></p>
<p>Neil Patel does a great outlining a <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2013/10/21/11-content-marketing-lessons-learned-from-20-of-the-top-100-blogs/">longterm approach to high-quality content</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can write great content, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you will see an increase in traffic. You can write crap content in large quantities, and you are more likely to see your traffic numbers go up.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, crap content will lead to disappointed readers, which hurts your long term traffic. Yes, in the short term, things will grow like a hockey stick, but once search engines continue to see that users are bouncing away and no one is willing to tweet your content or even link to it, eventually your traffic will tank.</p></blockquote>
<h2>6. Go Big.</h2>
<p>Mackenzie Fogelson from Mack Web Solutions recently wrote an amazing post on &ldquo;big&rdquo; content on the Moz blog. She recently released a 147-page guide on community building and details the experience <a href="http://moz.com/blog/5-strategic-steps-to-big-content">here</a>.</p>
<p>The point is this: &ldquo;big&rdquo; content draws attention. You can&rsquo;t do this every day but you can do it monthly or annually. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a PDF or ebook either. Here are a few ideas for big content that you can apply to nearly any vertical:</p>
<ul><li>100 best blogs in [vertical]</li>
<li>A crowdsourced list of tools for [target reader]</li>
<li>The complete history of [person, place, thing]</li>
</ul><p><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> Vero&rsquo;s new content strategy (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/revamped-content-strategy/">outlined here</a>) is focusing on big content (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">see it here</a>). So far, it&rsquo;s working really well (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/epic-post-breakdown/">look at the numbers here</a>).</p>
<h2>7. Don&rsquo;t publish during happy hour.</h2>
<p>So many bloggers are guilty of this. You spend all day working on a great post. By the time you finish, most of the office has gone home or hit up a nearby happy hour. You are so excited about your post that you hit &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; at 5pm on a Friday. It gets lost of a sea of disinterest and by the time Monday rolls around, it&rsquo;s too late to resuscitate your dying article.</p>
<p>Plan to publish at peak times. Belle Beth Cooper offers these suggestions on the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/best-time-to-tweet-post-to-facebook-send-emails-publish-blogposts" target="_blank">Buffer blog</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>70% of users say they read blogs in the morning</li>
<li>More men read blogs at night than women</li>
<li>Mondays are the highest traffic days for an average blog</li>
<li>11am is usually the highest traffic hour for an average blog</li>
<li>Comments are usually highest on Saturdays and around 9am on most days</li>
<li>Blogs that post more than once per day have a higher chance of inbound links and more unique views</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Based on this insight, plan for greatness by posting early in the week and early in the day. It gives you time to promote and your audience time to respond.</p>
<h2>8. Drop an email.</h2>
<p>The people on your <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/grow-your-email-list/">email list</a> are there because they 1) value what you have to say and 2) appreciate your work enough allow you to communicate with them. Permission marketing is based on trust. If you have a truly great resource for your readers, email them. Just be careful not to abuse this privilege. Their trust in you in fundamental in the success of your blog and your business.</p>
<h2>9. This isn&rsquo;t a press release so approach it differently.</h2>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/on-startups/ba600f39a13d" target="_blank">Press releases are dead</a> because public relations firms don&rsquo;t understand how the media works. Luckily for bloggers &ndash; who are the new media &ndash; your content is much, much more valuable than a press release.</p>
<p>Every blogger has gotten a press release asking them to write about a product or person. It&rsquo;s a cry for help, a shameless sales pitch. <strong>When promoting your content, don&rsquo;t act like a PR person!</strong></p>
<p>As a blogger, you have already found a great topic and written an interesting post. <strong>The work is done, you are just letting people know about it.</strong> Be careful to avoid sounding like PR person &hellip; it&rsquo;s a surefire way to kill interest in your work.</p>
<p>Instead, act like a journalist. You want to pitch your content, not sell it. For example, you might email the editor of a popular blog with an excerpt of your post to say &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve got this great article that I think your audience would appreciate.&rdquo; Or you could @ mention them in a tweet or tag them in a Google+ post. There are so many ways to connect with influential people outside of selling to them.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&rsquo;s note:</strong> See how we earned <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/epic-post-breakdown/">300+ links and 2,500+ social shares</a> on a single post with this exact strategy.</p>
<h2>10. Post links carefully.</h2>
<p>Forget about directory submissions. They don&rsquo;t work. What does work, however, is posting on submission sites and message boards. There are a number of submission sites that can send hoarded of interested readers to your content if you approach them carefully.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Reddit.</strong> Self-promoting isn&rsquo;t outright banned on Reddit but it&rsquo;s certainly frowned upon. The great thing about Reddit is that there is a Subreddit for just about every topic. The down side is that without a lot of listening, commenting and engagement on your part, your submissions will likely go unnoticed. If you decide to post on Reddit &ndash; and you should if your content is valuable enough &ndash; make sure you follow the rules. (Each Subreddit has a list of rules on its sidebar.) It&rsquo;s also wise not to lead with a link. Get involved in a Subreddit by commenting and listening before promoting a piece of content.</li>
<li><strong>StumbleUpon.</strong> You can submit a lot of links to StumbleUpon assuming that they are interesting or noteworthy. Don&rsquo;t bother submitting news-jacking articles, which are fine to write but require a different approach to successfully promote. Instead, choose your best work and submit it under the proper category. The results may surprise you.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest.</strong> Visual aids can improve nearly every post. You don&rsquo;t need to create an entire infographic but you could select a poignant quote and pair it with a graphic. <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> makes this really easy. You could also create a pie chart or bar graph with tools like <a href="http://piktochart.com" target="_blank">Piktochart</a> or <a href="https://infogr.am" target="_blank">Infogr.am</a>. Once you create these assets, Pinterest is a great place to put them to work. Create boards for lots of topics and post your work here.</li>
<li><strong>Google+.</strong> One of the best features of Google+ is the <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/communities/">Communities</a>. Just like a real community, you have to give in order to receive. Get engaged in relevant communities and you will likely find a willing audience when you have something great to promote.</li>
</ul><h2>11. Ask for links politely.</h2>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.quickmeme.com/img/b7/b7eab20785cfdb8a2987f710cf52a95f96f1f7967c8f92e7039d50b82f739708.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>There is a right way and a wrong way to ask for a link. Here is an example of the right way.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve built a good relationship with another blogger. You frequently link to their work, you chat on Twitter and you are hoping to find a time to meet up for coffee soon.</p>
<p>Over the past week, you&rsquo;ve been pouring your heart and soul into an awesome post. It&rsquo;s a great resource for the community and you know that your audience will eat it up. Once it&rsquo;s posted, you ask your blogger friend if they would consider linking to it in a future post or sharing it on Twitter. If your relationship is based on trust and value, and your content is as great as you think, it&rsquo;s highly likely your friend will link to your work. Return the favor sometime. Or, even better, link to their work <em>before</em> you publish.</p>
<h2>12. Create content about your content.</h2>
<p>You can promote your own content internally as well as externally. For example, link to your &ldquo;big&rdquo; content on a regular basis in other posts. You should also include your best content in roundup posts occasionally. Build old posts into your social media schedule &ndash; <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/evergreen-post-tweeter/" target="_blank">Evergreen Post Tweeter</a> automates this on WordPress blogs &ndash; to stretch out their life and write follow up posts as your topics evolve.</p>
<h2>13. Repeat.</h2>
<p>Content promotion is an ongoing cycle. Your network of bloggers will always be growing, your audience will expand and your strategies will become more effective. You will learn where to promote content, who you can rely on for a link and when to publish posts for the greatest impact. Pretty soon, your work will promote itself, leaving you with more time to work on the next great post.</p>
