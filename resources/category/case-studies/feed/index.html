<html><body><p>Transparency is hot right now, but not in email marketing.</p>
<p>You can see how many Twitter followers a brand has. Lots of businesses blog about their audience growth. And some newsletters share their subscriber count as <a href="/resources/social-proof">social proof</a>.</p>
<p>But no one talks about open and click rates, ROI or impact on the bottom line. It&rsquo;s taboo in the email world.</p>
<p><span id="more-6889"></span></p>
<p>That makes it really hard to find email marketing case studies. If you want inspiration for your own campaigns, there aren&rsquo;t many options. You can:</p>
<ul><li>Read blogs like this one</li>
<li>Dive into <a href="http://reallygoodemails.com/" target="_blank">ReallyGoodEmails.com</a></li>
<li>Sign up for newsletters and products to receive their emails</li>
</ul><p>Other than that, all you can do is test your assumptions relentlessly.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to make it a little easier to read stories about great email campaigns so we collected some of our favorites. Here is the criteria for the case studies we included:</p>
<ul><li>They are real case studies, not a <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">best practices</a> pieces.</li>
<li>They include quotes or data from the campaign creators.</li>
</ul><p>That sounds simple until you start exploring the web for stories that meet those two rules. We&rsquo;d like to add to this list so if you know of a great email story, let us know in the comments.</p>

<h2>What Startups Can Learn from Watsi&rsquo;s Wildly Successful Email Campaign</h2>
<p>This story is too nuanced to accurately summarize but here&rsquo;s a primer.</p>
<p><a href="https://watsi.org/" target="_blank">Watsi</a> is the first non-profit to be part of Y Combinator. They crowdsource healthcare funding for people all over the world. To drive recurring revenue, they broke out their monthly donation feature into its own product and launched it separately.</p>
<p>They used email to source early feedback, used <a href="/resources/social-proof">social proof </a> to create buzz and built a personalized newsletter to keep users informed about their donations.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet from this post:</p>
<blockquote class="snippet"><p>Part of showing people what they&rsquo;re getting is investing in communications where you aren&rsquo;t asking for anything. Instead, you&rsquo;re thanking people for their business or their participation. You&rsquo;re acknowledging your end of the deal where you&rsquo;re committed to delighting and surprising them. This is something that for-profit startups tend to neglect &ndash; the importance of not just sending a receipt for a purchase, but honing that interaction to make customers feel something more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Email marketing is isn&rsquo;t a channel &ndash; it&rsquo;s one layer of a customer-centric company. This case study reveals how complex (and truly valuable) it is to use email to grow a business.</p>
<h2>Building a Newsletter Welcome Series from Scratch</h2>
<p>Help Scout&rsquo;s signature flair is <em>purpose</em>.</p>
<p>As they considered how to welcome to new subscribers &ndash; and there are more than 51,000 &ndash; they knew that aligning business goals with a great experience was key. They pulled it off by ensuring each email sought to achieve a single, measurable goal.</p>

<p>Each of the five emails in the sequence is explained in detail, including the intended purpose and suggestions based on their own learnings.</p>
<h2>How The Skimm&rsquo;s passionate readership helped its newsletter grow to 1.5 million subscribers</h2>
<p>Building a profitable business with email is very different than using email to build a profitable business.</p>
<p>Watsi, for example, uses email to support their product. In <a href="http://www.theskimm.com/" target="_blank">The Skimm&rsquo;s</a> case, the email <em>is</em> the product. When newsletters become a business, it&rsquo;s worth paying careful attention to their strategy. (We detailed an example of this in our <a href="/resources/guides/death-to-the-stock-photo/" target="_blank">Death to the Stock Photo case study</a>.)</p>
<p>The Skimm&rsquo;s email newsletter reaches 1.5 million daily. That growth has been fueled by an intense understanding of their target reader and an community that is eager to help. There are more than 6,000 &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theskimm.com/skimm-guides/skimmbassadors" target="_blank">Skimm&rsquo;bassadors</a>&rdquo; actively spreading the word about this business.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/210470887&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to learn here but if you take just one lesson, let it be this:</p>
<p>The Skimm focuses on women ages 22-34 in big cities throughout the country. They are busy, they&rsquo;re on the go. It&rsquo;s a professional audience. And we looked at what they do first thing in the morning. Your alarm goes off, you grab your phone, and you read emails from friends and family first.</p>
<p>It really made sense to us to introduce a product that fit in with that routine. And email is very much in the routines of the demo that we&rsquo;re going after.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel. Meet your target audience where they&rsquo;re already active.</p>
<h2>How to Gather 100,000 Emails in One Week</h2>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re noticing a trend in these case studies: <strong>Pulling off a wildly successful email campaign isn&rsquo;t easy.</strong></p>
<p>Even when the goals are simple, the logistics tend to get messy. The smartest&Acirc;&nbsp;companies dig in anyway.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.harrys.com/" target="_blank">Harry&rsquo;s</a> case, they used a landing page to gather 100,000 emails in the week leading up their launch. As a shaving company, they are competing against institutions like Gillette. The only way to outsell them is to out-maneuver them.</p>

<p>Harry&rsquo;s drove traffic to a landing page, asked for a signup, then used a referral mechanism to incentivize people to share the product. Those who referred friends earned free products. They gave away a ton of free razors that week but it cost way less than broadcasting the upcoming launch on traditional advertising channels.</p>
<p>This post gets into the nitty gritty of driving the traffic, managing the flood of interest and actually delivering the free products.</p>
<h2>The Art and Science of Turning Free Trials Into Happy Customers</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a small startup, you&rsquo;ll be able to relate to this story.</p>
<p>Alex Smith runs marketing at <a href="http://www.contactmonkey.com/" target="_blank">ContactMonkey</a>. As a growing company with a small team, it became too difficult to onboard new customers one at a time. So Alex created a series of events in the application that trigger emails or pause existing campaigns.</p>
<p>The result was not only happier customers, but faster growth. Once the triggers were in place, ContactMonkey was able to guarantee that each customer received the right messaging at the right time.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/vero-and-contact-monkey-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This post shares the exact emails and triggers ContactMonkey uses to onboarding their users, along with some ideas for blurring the lines between CRM and email marketing.</p>
<h2>The Science Behind Those Obama Campaign E-Mails</h2>
<p>I think this line will pique your interest about Obama&rsquo;s last campaign: <strong>&ldquo;Most of the $690 million Obama raised online came from fundraising e-mails.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Hot damn.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign famously used a casual, conversational in tone in the email subject lines. The most famous subject line was simply &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; Another &ndash; &ldquo;I will be outspent&rdquo; &ndash; raised $2.6 million on its own.</p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. The folks behind the campaigns tested incessantly, sometimes playing with a dozen or more variations on a single email. Here&rsquo;s one of the most interesting findings revealed by digital analytics directo Amelia Showalter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&hellip;these triumphs were fleeting. There was no such thing as the perfect e-mail; every breakthrough had a shelf life. &ldquo;Eventually the novelty wore off, and we had to go back and retest,&rdquo; says Showalter.</p></blockquote>
<p>They bottled lightening over and over through rigorous testing and exceptional copywriting. The viral effect was manufactured, not serendipitous.</p>
<h2>What We Learned From A Week Of Prototyping A Newsletter In Public</h2>
<p>When Buzzfeed began developing a daily email newsletter, the editors turned to Facebook for feedback. They shared their prototypes (<a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/c0b8446c-47d4-4547-bce5-e623c727a77c/5002a72023baa637" target="_blank">here&rsquo;s an example</a>) with their own friends. They made each iteration of the newsletter public to ensure they could patch any holes before launch.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="489px"><img data-attachment-id="6896" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-case-studies/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?fit=489%2C379&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="489,379" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="buzzfeed email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?fit=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?fit=489%2C379&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6896" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png" alt="buzzfeed email" width="489" height="379" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?w=489&amp;ssl=1 489w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?resize=129%2C100&amp;ssl=1 129w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?resize=50%2C39&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/enhanced-29510-1427396962-11-1.png?resize=75%2C58&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"></p>
<p>Interestingly, editor Millie Tran said the most useful part of this exercise was the intense focus on the product/market fit:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most valuable thing about this exercise was that it allowed us to avoid getting too emotionally attached to any one idea early on and to keep tweaking and adjusting the product to be better.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve written before, <a href="/resources/product-loop" target="_blank">email is an extension of your product</a> and should be treated with the appropriate care.</p>
<p>Buzzfeed also wrote a <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/millietran/minimum-delightful-to-maximum-impact-what-testing-via-email#.mcB31ezVe" target="_blank">follow-up to this post</a> about using email to test early versions of their mobile app.</p>
<h2>Learning vs. Selling</h2>
<p>This is a personal story based on my experience here at Vero. Last year, we created 14-step campaign to welcome new subscribers to the blog. The open rates were decent and we heard some positive feedback from customers about the campaign.</p>
<p>Then we nuked it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it a) wasn&rsquo;t helping us convert readers into customers and b) it wasn&rsquo;t helping us learn about our readers. We replaced the entire campaign with a single email.</p>

<h2>The Most Successful E-mail I Ever Wrote</h2>
<p>A single email can change a business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Like most &ldquo;growth hacks,&rdquo; the value of A/B testing has been lost in the rush for game-changing results <em>today</em>.</p>
<p>As any experienced marketer or entrepreneur knows, there are no silver bullets when it comes to scaling a business. A/B testing, like every other tactic, has its place in the marketing toolbox. Used correctly, it can drive incremental gains. Many incremental gains lead to traction, which can lead to real growth.</p>
<p>A/B testing is as important for the mindset as it is the data. A commitment to A/B testing is an indicator that you&rsquo;re running a data-driven business. Going with your gut has its place too &ndash; usually alongside a carefully crafted control.</p>
<p>So what constitutes a meaningful A/B test? First, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the scientific method, which lays a good foundation for running tests that produce valid results.</p>
<p>Here is a brief but useful definition of the scientific method from <a href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_scientific_method.shtml#overviewofthescientificmethod" target="_blank">ScienceBuddies.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The scientific method is a process for experimentation that is used to explore observations and answer questions. Scientists use the scientific method to search for cause and effect relationships in nature. In other words, <strong>they design an experiment so that changes to one item cause something else to vary in a predictable way</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s quickly see how that applies to marketing, specifically email.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Ask a question:</strong> Why don&rsquo;t more people click our emails?</li>
<li><strong>Do background research:</strong> What are <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">best practices for email copy</a>?</li>
<li><strong>Construct a hypothesis:</strong> More people will click our emails if we integrate behavioral data.</li>
<li><strong>Test with an experiment:</strong> Test existing copy (control) against new, dynamic copy (variable).</li>
<li><strong>Analyze data and draw conclusions:</strong> Behavioral data added context to emails, therefore driving more clicks.</li>
<li><strong>Implement learnings:</strong> Include behavioral data in email campaigns, move on to next test.</li>
</ul><p>Done correctly, A/B testing produces exponential improvement. They key is implementing a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">series of onboarding, lifecycle and retention emails</a>, then testing them rigorously, as opposed to A/B testing subject lines in every promotional email you send.</p>
<p>Testing one-off emails produces one-off learnings. If you were to send that same campaign again, you could improve on it. But since you aren&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t apply your learnings to the next email. Testing automated campaigns, however, means you can constantly improve the results. A steady flow of new users provides continual feedback and, if you are committed to the data, you can regularly update copy, images, buttons, triggers and timing to send the best possible emails.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to consider that testing small variations will likely produce small variations in the results. As Noah Kagan wrote on the <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/a-b-testing-tips/" target="_blank">Visual Website Optimizer blog</a>, only one in eight A/B test drives significant change. Unless you&rsquo;re <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-amazon-experience/">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">TripAdvisor</a>, your data pool isn&rsquo;t large enough that decimal points matter. If <strong>Email A</strong> has a 15.2% click rate and <strong>Email B</strong> has a 14.8% click rate, did <strong>Email A</strong> really win? You can&rsquo;t be sure, and you likely didn&rsquo;t put enough creative effort into a truly varied A/B test.</p>
<h2>Udemy: A/B Testing in Action</h2>
<p>With more than seven million students, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> has a massive user base to test. That creates really meaningful results, which Udemy uses to constantly iterate on their email campaigns.</p>
<p>Jen Rhee, Udemy&rsquo;s email marketing manager, was kind enough to share the results of two recent A/B tests with us. Jen is a leader in this fast growing organization, and our conversation confirmed that she is methodical in her approach to growth.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into the examples.</p>
<h3>Example #1: The Welcome Email</h3>
<p>We often said that your <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a> sets the tone for your relationship with new users, but Jen has data to back that up. She has found that revenue generated in the first week correlates with an increased customer lifetime value. That means the welcome email could set the trajectory for what could be a valuable relationship. It could also prevent that relationship from ever happening.</p>
<p>To improve these emails, Jen put their existing welcome email (the control) up against a new one (the variable). The control email welcomed new users with 50 percent off any course. It&rsquo;s an enticing deal but it&rsquo;s also very open-ended. Even though the email included some suggested courses, the email header was pretty general.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6656" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/daniel-tay/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/daniel-tay.jpg?fit=390%2C390&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="390,390" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="daniel-tay" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/daniel-tay.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/daniel-tay.jpg?fit=390%2C390&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full example-email wp-image-6656" src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/udemy-welcome-email-control.png?resize=639%2C564" alt="udemy welcome email control" width="639" height="564"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Jen suspected that suggesting a course right off the bat would drive more early revenue, which would increase lifetime value and set the tone for a great customer experience. Her variable email leveraged behavioral data to serve up a course that the user had already expressed interest in. She included that course in the email header, along with the same 50 percent off coupon.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6658" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/rss-30/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rss-30.png?fit=30%2C30&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="30,30" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rss-30" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rss-30.png?fit=30%2C30&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rss-30.png?fit=30%2C30&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full example-email wp-image-6658" src="https://i2.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/welcome_intent_t2.jpg?resize=669%2C443" alt="welcome_intent_t2" width="669" height="443"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Before I tell you the results, consider that you probably already know which email performed better. Jen felt the same way, but ran the test anyway. Assumptions are just that &ndash; baseless suppositions that ought to be verified.</p>
<p>As expected, the second email was a smashing success. It generated 150 percent more revenue in the first week, and 94 percent revenue in the first 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Behavioral data adds context to emails. Each time this is email is triggered, the content is unique. This is personalization at its finest. Suggesting one course, as opposed to just offering a coupon, removes friction from the buying process, making it easier for new users to get started.</p>
<h3>Example #2: The Lifecycle Email</h3>
<p>In marketing, you&rsquo;re often either fighting inertia or riding momentum.</p>
<p>Email is one of the primary ways to build on momentum, which can lead to happier, more engaged customers. With this in mind, Jen began testing their &ldquo;post enroll&rdquo; email campaign, which was triggered after users purchased their first course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got some insight from our users that they purchase a course with goals in mind,&rdquo; Jen told us. &ldquo;If they buy a Photoshop course, they want to create beautiful designs. If they take an app development course, they want to build apps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To improve Udemy&rsquo;s lifecycle emails, Jen ran a test similar to the one above. The existing campaign offered a coupon code with a generic call to action to &ldquo;Discover Courses.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="447px"><img data-attachment-id="6660" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/buffer/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buffer.png?fit=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="100,100" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="buffer" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buffer.png?fit=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buffer.png?fit=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone example-email size-full wp-image-6660" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/post_enroll_next_t2.jpg?resize=447%2C525" alt="post_enroll_next_t2" width="447" height="525"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>She tested this against a benefits-oriented header that said, in the case of users who bought app development courses, &ldquo;Make An App That Everyone Will Want&rdquo; along with a coupon code.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6659" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/50-awesome-marketing-blogs/twitter-50/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/twitter-50.png?fit=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="50,29" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="twitter-50" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/twitter-50.png?fit=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/twitter-50.png?fit=50%2C29&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full example-email wp-image-6659" src="https://i1.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/learningpaths-hero.jpg?resize=660%2C339" alt="learningpaths-hero" width="660" height="339"  data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>As you might expect, the second email was a runaway hit. It generated 60 percent more short-term revenue, and 132 percent more long-term revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> As Jen told us, &ldquo;Customizing the creative based on the student&rsquo;s goals performed better than focusing on coupons alone.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a classic case of <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/blog/benefits-sell/" target="_blank">benefits vs. features</a> that Udemy has been able to leverage for a higher customer lifetime value.</p>
<h2>The Secret Sauce</h2>
<p>The key to Jen&rsquo;s success at Udemy hasn&rsquo;t been coming up with creative test ideas or even designing and implementing the tests. Jen actually reports on her findings and uses the knowledge to improve the emails. As the campaigns run and collect more data, she tests another idea and iterates again.</p>
<p>A/B testing is a cycle, not a campaign. The next time you arbitrarily A/B test your newsletter&rsquo;s subject line, don&rsquo;t expect tangible results. The real insights stem from a culture of testing and a commitment to data.</p>
<p>Do you have questions for Jen or about A/B testing in general? Leave a note in the comments.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>How long has &ldquo;Update the onboarding emails&rdquo; been on your to-do list?</p>
<p>Onboarding is the process of getting new users to &ldquo;first value&rdquo; as quickly as possible. The sooner customers use your product&rsquo;s best features, the sooner they&rsquo;ll see an ROI on their investment and the more likely they are to stay.</p>
<p>Onboarding is especially pertinent for businesses that offer free trials and freemium plans. If you can&rsquo;t show non-paying users why your product is worth paying for, don&rsquo;t expect them to hand over their credit card. A good onboarding sequence generates revenue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s high time you got this done.</p>
<h2>Don&rsquo;t Overthink It</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling to setup your onboarding emails, you&rsquo;re likely overthinking it.</p>
<p>You might expect that a large company like Evernote has a sophisticated onboarding process, tons of behavioral triggers and a braintrust to manage the operation. In fact, just the opposite is true. Evernote sends some of the most basic (and useful) onboarding emails I&rsquo;ve ever seen. They do blend some behavioral emails into the mix but for the most part, they simply deliver information that every user would find valuable.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about <a href="https://blog.getvero.com/evernote/">Evernote&rsquo;s emails</a> on this blog before but today we&rsquo;ll take a deeper dive. Evernote&rsquo;s onboarding emails are simple, straightforward and effective. Whether you&rsquo;re just getting started with onboarding or ready to upgrade your existing process, let this case study serve as a template and spark to get it done.</p>
<h2>An Overview</h2>
<p>The primary goal of every onboarding campaign is to get new users engaged quickly, but there are other business objectives at play too. In Evernote&rsquo;s case, they are looking to get free users to upgrade to their premium level. Of course, they can&rsquo;t do that without proving the value of the product first, so they lead with information and follow-up with calls to action.</p>
<p>Evernote orients news users with five emails that show the app&rsquo;s capabilities. Each offers a tip, then encourages the user to try it out. (You can see each of these emails below.) Evernote lets users know from the beginning that there will be five emails in the sequence. This sets an expectation and helps new users feel progress as they read and take action on each.</p>

<p>This is the core of the onboarding experience but there are a few other messages to supplement it. Here is a quick overview of the complete campaign.</p>
<div id="toc"><div class="toc blue"><a href="#1"><span class="number">Day 1 </span><span class="title">Welcome Email</span></a></div><div class="toc green"><a href="#3"><span class="number">Day 3 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 1</span></a></div><div class="toc red"><a href="#10"><span class="number">Day 10 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 2</span></a></div><div class="toc gray-blue"><a href="#17"><span class="number">Day 17 </span><span class="title">Promotional Email No. 1</span></a></div><div class="toc orange"><a href=""><span class="number">Day 19 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 3</span></a></div><div class="toc purple"><a href="#27"><span class="number">Day 27 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 4</span></a></div><div class="toc orange"><a href="#29"><span class="number">Day 29 </span><span class="title">Did you know?</span></a></div><div class="toc gray-blue"><a href="#31"><span class="number">Day 31 </span><span class="title">Promotional Email No. 2</span></a></div><div class="toc blue"><a href="#33"><span class="number">Day 33 </span><span class="title">Milestone Email</span></a></div><div class="toc red"><a href="#36"><span class="number">Day 36 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 5</span></a></div></div>
<p>Pretty straightforward, right? Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at each individual message.</p>
<div class="toc title blue" id="1"><h2><span class="number">Day 1 </span><span class="title">The Welcome Email</span></h2></div>
<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-emails/">Welcome emails</a> should be clear, concise and actionable. Evernote&rsquo;s welcome email meets that criteria.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6560" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/guides/evernote-onboarding/evernote-welcome-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?fit=733%2C764&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="733,764" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="evernote welcome email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?fit=288%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?fit=733%2C764&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6560 example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg" alt="evernote welcome email" width="733" height="764" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?w=733&amp;ssl=1 733w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?resize=288%2C300&amp;ssl=1 288w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?resize=96%2C100&amp;ssl=1 96w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?resize=48%2C50&amp;ssl=1 48w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-welcome-email.jpg?resize=72%2C75&amp;ssl=1 72w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></p>
<p>Instead of leading with a generic subject line like &ldquo;Welcome to Evernote&rdquo;, they chose something more specific: &ldquo;Get Started with Evernote&rdquo;. The phrase implies action, which the new user will need to take in order to start using the app.</p>
<p>Often, copy gets in the way of action. Tell your users what to do and get out of the way. Evernote keeps it short and sweet, telling the user to click the bold, green button to download the app. Users can&rsquo;t get value from Evernote without the app, so it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary that they take this step.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, users can use the same email on multiple devices and the link will take them to the appropriate application, i.e. iOS, Mac OS X, Android, etc. The same is true of the link to &ldquo;Introduction to Evernote&rdquo;, which opens the correct help docs article depending on the device the person is using.</p>
<div class="toc title green" id="3"><h2><span class="number">Day 3 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 1</span></h2></div>
<p>You might think your product is easy to use, but put yourself in your users&rsquo; shoes. They didn&rsquo;t build the app. They don&rsquo;t use it every day. Onboarding emails should be focused on the smallest, easiest ways new users can get value from your app, regardless of how trivial the first steps seem.</p>
<p>Evernote starts at the very beginning: creating the first note.</p>

<p>This email details a few things users can put in their first note like text, audio and images, then directs them to a <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/05/18/quick-tip-friday-capture-multiple-types-of-media-in-a-single-note/">blog post</a> that goes into more detail.</p>
<p>This is a great way to maximize the content you&rsquo;re likely already creating. Not all of your content should be focused on your product but when there is overlap, you might as well give it to the people that need it most.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using content in onboarding is that people can leave comments with questions and feedback. The post linked in this email has more than 90 comments. That serves as a form of social proof, will likely help the post rank better in search and gives new users a platform to ask questions.</p>
<div class="toc title red" id="10"><h2><span class="number">Day 10 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 2</span></h2></div>
<p>The ability to use Evernote on multiple devices is obviously useful. They already made an effort to get new users to download the desktop and mobile apps in the first email, and now they are selling the benefits of that feature.</p>

<p>Evernote references their last email before encouraging the next step. If they haven&rsquo;t accomplished the task assigned in the previous email, this serves as a gentle reminder.</p>
<blockquote><p>After you&rsquo;ve captured a note, you can access it from any smartphone, tablet and computer where you&rsquo;ve installed Evernote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, the link is dynamic, meaning it will know which device the user is on and send them to the appropriate download page.</p>
<div class="toc title blue-gray" id="17"><h2><span class="number">Day 17 </span><span class="title">Promotional Email No. 1</span></h2></div>
<p>This is the first of two promotional emails in the onboarding sequence. Evernote is wise not lead with this as users need time to sink their teeth into the app before deciding if it&rsquo;s worth upgrading.</p>

<p>Peep Laja, founder of <a href="https://conversionxl.com/what-to-call-your-call-to-action/">ConversionXL</a>, suggests that you &ldquo;use brief but meaningful link text that explains what the link or button offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evernote has done just this. The value proposition &ndash; &ldquo;Always have the notes you need &hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; is clear and the button tells you exactly what will happen when you click it.</p>
<p>As always, clarity reigns supreme in conversion rate optimization (CRO).</p>

<p>Suggesting use-cases for a product is one of the best ways to get people using it. Evernote is a blank slate in the beginning and, like most apps, it gets more valuable as users spend more time in it. Providing a few suggestions is an excellent way to show (rather than tell) people how it works.</p>

<p>The gap between education and activation is difficult to bridge. (<a href="http://blog.getvero.com/education-to-activation/">More on that here.</a>) One company that has cracked this nut is IFTTT. Their <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes">recipe library</a> accomplishes three difficult tasks all at once:</p>
<ul><li>It shows people how the product works;</li>
<li>Lets users browse real use-cases;</li>
<li>And allows users to implement those actions with just one click.</li>
</ul><p>Evernote doesn&rsquo;t take it this far but they are moving in that direction with their <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/category/tips-stories/">Tips &amp; Stories</a> blog. Product-centric content can be both educational and &hellip; activational. (I think I just coined a new marketing term.)</p>

<p>A simple &ldquo;How to&rdquo; should appear at least once in every onboarding campaign. Providing users with ideas for using your product and encouraging them to download apps are vital, but users will need instruction to get going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to&rdquo; posts aren&rsquo;t just a simple structure for educational content, they are also a great way to capture attention. The trick is to over-deliver so that by the end of the email or post, the user is satisfied. In <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/">How to Write Magnetic Headlines</a>, Copyblogger&rsquo;s Brian Clark says, &ldquo;writing a killer &lsquo;how to&rsquo; headline will help you write even better &lsquo;how to&rsquo; content when you fulfill the headline promise you made to get people to read in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this case, Evernote promises instruction in the subject line, sells the value of taking action in the body, and sends users to their blog for a detailed explanation.</p>
<div class="toc title orange" id="29"><h2><span class="number">Day 29 </span><span class="title">"Did you know?"</span></h2></div>
<p>This email is an interesting deviation from the five-step plan. Evernote places a lot of emphasis on sending emails into their app &ndash; there&rsquo;s more evidence of that on day 33 &ndash; and I think I know why.</p>

<p>Ben Yoskovitz, VP Product at VarageSale, <a href="http://www.instigatorblog.com/onboarding-for-long-term-engagement/2015/01/05/">suggests</a> looking at your best existing customers and figuring out what they did early on. Then, start driving all new users to those key actions with the goal of turning them into happy longterm customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine for example that you find a relationship between users taking a particular action (e.g. following another user, posting content, searching, etc.) and their long-term engagement with your product. Users that take this particular action stick around much longer (they don&rsquo;t churn out) and generally represent your better, more engaged participants. That&rsquo;s a critical piece of information that you can now bring back into your onboarding experience.</p>
<p>The key is to get people to take the key action as early as possible in their use of your product.</p></blockquote>
<p>Evernote has likely found that their best users frequently forward emails into their app. It&rsquo;s an action with a very low barrier to entry and is associated with power users, many of whom are likely premium users.</p>
<div class="toc title blue-gray" id="31"><h2><span class="number">Day 31 </span><span class="title">Promotional Email No. 2</span></h2></div>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the second (and final) promotion for the premium service.</p>
<p>Evernote clearly understands context &ndash; the unfair advantage that nearly all marketers overlook. We wrote an entire post on one <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/evernote/">Evernote promotional email</a> and there is a lot of crossover from that post here.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6567" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/guides/evernote-onboarding/evernote-promotional-email-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?fit=728%2C875&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="728,875" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="evernote promotional email 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?fit=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?fit=728%2C875&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6567 example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg" alt="evernote promotional email 2" width="728" height="875" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?w=728&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?resize=250%2C300&amp;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?resize=83%2C100&amp;ssl=1 83w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?resize=42%2C50&amp;ssl=1 42w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-promotional-email-2.jpg?resize=62%2C75&amp;ssl=1 62w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>By the time users get this email, they have already received seven other emails from Evernote. They&rsquo;ve had a chance to use the app. They are starting to see the value of using Evernote more, and maybe using it replace other apps.</p>
<p>Evernote uses their onboarding emails to create demand for their own product. Then, when the iron is hot, they strike with calls to action like this one.</p>
<div class="toc title blue" id="33"><h2><span class="number">Day 33 </span><span class="title">Milestone Email</span></h2></div>
<p>If you want to build momentum with new users, think about creating a few <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/behavioral-emails/#milestone">milestone emails</a>. These messages are triggered when users take a desired action and congratulate them for &lsquo;good behavior.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is the third and final piece of evidence that Evernote <em>really</em> wants news users to try the email feature.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6568" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/guides/evernote-onboarding/evernote-milestone-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?fit=731%2C1089&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="731,1089" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="evernote milestone email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?fit=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?fit=687%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6568 example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg" alt="evernote milestone email" width="731" height="1089" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?resize=201%2C300&amp;ssl=1 201w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?resize=687%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 687w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?resize=67%2C100&amp;ssl=1 67w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?resize=34%2C50&amp;ssl=1 34w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-milestone-email.jpg?resize=50%2C75&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px"></p>
<p>As we mentioned in our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">massive guide to lifecycle emails</a>, milestone emails reinforce the value your product, then encourage users to take the next step. This email accomplishes that by acknowledging past behavior, then offering suggestions to make the experience even better next time.</p>
<p>Write milestone emails with confidence. You can&rsquo;t <em>hope</em> there is a next time, you must <em>know</em> &ndash; or at least write like you do.</p>
<div class="toc title red" id="36"><h2><span class="number">Day 36 </span><span class="title">Onboarding Email No. 5</span></h2></div>
<p>Just like the other emails in the series, this one relies on content and instruction to explain utility and value. It&rsquo;s a simple formula but works.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6569" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/guides/evernote-onboarding/evernote-onboarding-email-5/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?fit=720%2C742&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="720,742" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="evernote onboarding email 5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?fit=291%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?fit=720%2C742&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6569 example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg" alt="evernote onboarding email 5" width="720" height="742" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?resize=291%2C300&amp;ssl=1 291w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?resize=97%2C100&amp;ssl=1 97w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evernote-onboarding-email-5.jpg?resize=73%2C75&amp;ssl=1 73w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p>
<p>This email concludes the five-step series, but it&rsquo;s just the beginning of Evernote&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle marketing</a>. From here, users receive notifications about their account, newsletters with new content on the Evernote blog and occasional promotions from the Evernote Marketing.</p>
<p>Thanks to its lack of unnecessary complexity, this campaign is highly effective. Are you ready to finally update your own onboarding emails? Draw inspiration from Evernote and get it done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>ContactMonkey &ndash; an app that brings Salesforce data and email tracking into Outlook and Gmail &ndash; recently ran into an onboarding problem.</p>
<p>ContactMonkey&rsquo;s Chief Marketing Officer, Alex Smith, noticed that new users were having a hard time getting acquainted with the application. This meant they weren&rsquo;t getting to see whether or not the tool could effectively solve their problems.</p>
<p>In other words, Alex&rsquo;s  customers weren&rsquo;t having the <strong>great experience</strong> he was trying to create, and this bothered him. An experienced marketer, Alex was confident that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle email</a> could help solve this onboarding challenge and give customers the right advice &ndash; or a chance to speak up &ndash; at the right time.</p>
<p>The trick, he soon realized, was finding an easy way to automate drip campaigns based on behavior, and not just time.</p>
<h2>A Good Problem to Have</h2>
<p>The crux of Alex&rsquo;s challenge was that too many users were signing up with <a href="http://www.contactmonkey.com/" target="_blank">ContactMonkey&rsquo;s app</a>, which made communicating with new customers more difficult than it needed to be. He hacked together some triggered emails with Ruby on Rails but it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p><img width="780" class="right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/at-table-discussing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="image-quote">ContactMonkey founder and CEO Scott Pielsticker and Alex both know that if customers don&rsquo;t engage with ContactMonkey, they won&rsquo;t become happy, paying customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had some emails being generated by our Rails web app but I couldn&rsquo;t edit them because I don&rsquo;t know Rails very well,&rdquo; Alex explained. &ldquo;I always needed our developers to help me adjust the content and triggers of these emails. It really wasn&rsquo;t ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sat down to address this challenge, he realized the problem was two-fold:</p>
<ol><li>He wasn&rsquo;t targeting his current onboarding emails sufficiently. They were simplistic, and didn&rsquo;t actually serve customers.</li>
<li>He couldn&rsquo;t edit the emails himself, which meant he couldn&rsquo;t easily test or change what he was doing.</li>
</ol><p>&ldquo;I needed something more flexible, and I needed a way to gather data so I could actually improve our onboarding experience,&rdquo; Alex said.</p>
<p>It was clear he needed a hand.</p>
<h2>Finding the Perfect Solution</h2>
<p>ContactMonkey relies heavily on data, analytics and event-tracking, so it didn&rsquo;t take Alex long to find what he was looking for: <strong>Vero</strong>. Once he got up and running, he was able to tackle his onboarding challenge head-on.</p>
<p>First, Alex created a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a> that would  trigger when new users signed up.</p>
<p><img width="782" class="example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contactmonkey-welcome-email.png" alt="welcome email"></p>
<p>This email is fantastic because it actually helps ingratiate the new customer with the product. How? It explains clearly how the user can test out the product with an immediate result. Because it&rsquo;s triggered, Alex can rest assured that every new signup will start getting value right away.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vero replaces two or three customer success people. That saves us at least $12,000 to $15,000 per month.</p></blockquote>
<p>From here, customers fell into a few different groups, and Alex wanted to write customized emails that could help them relative to where they were in the customer lifecycle. The key buckets of users were:</p>
<ul><li>New users who took no action after signing up;</li>
<li>New users who tracked at least one email in ContactMonkey but never got any open or click data from their recipients;</li>
<li>New users who took some action and showed signs of understanding the product, and <em>then</em> became inactive.</li>
</ul><p>By splitting users into these key groups and understanding what activities defined each segment, Alex was able to create multi-step drip campaigns that had targeted, helpful messages for each individual ContactMonkey user. </p>
<p class="block small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/telling-from-door.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="image-quote">Alex consistently adds to and iterates on his triggered emails to improve his customers&rsquo; experience with ContactMonkey.</p>
<p>If a user does something new, like track a second email, Alex follows what they&rsquo;ve done and ensures they only get emails that would be useful to them. For example, if a customer starts using ContactMonkey regularly, they no longer receive any inactivity emails; instead, they&rsquo;ll start receiving emails full of tips and suggestions for getting the most out of ContactMonkey.</p>
<p><img width="782" class="example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/contact-monkey-inactivity-1.jpg" alt="contact monkey inactivity.jpg"></p>
<p>The campaigns Alex sends to new, inactive users rely heavily on ContactMonkey&rsquo;s help docs, customer support and the product itself. They&rsquo;re not designed to act like drones on autopilot but to provide information, create a conversation and follow-up with useful outreach.</p>
<p>Since each of these emails are based on behavior rather than time, Alex and the team at ContactMonkey never have to worry that active customers will get emails about inactivity.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vero is truly email marketing automation. I have used Vero to replace what I would have had to hire a whole team of people to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even better, Alex pointed out that by tracking events, his well-defined segments often perform better than manual emails &ndash; he never accidentally misses something a customer has done or bugs them at the wrong time for the wrong thing. </p>
<p>In focusing on customer experience, Alex went a step further and implemented <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/behavioral-emails/#milestone">milestone emails</a> that congratulate customers when they take various actions in the product.</p>
<p>In this example, a customer is congratulated for sending their test email with ContactMonkey:</p>
<p><img width="782" class="example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/contact-monkey-milestone-email-1.jpg" alt="contact monkey milestone email.jpg"></p>
<p>This reinforces the behavior and helps the new customer build momentum.</p>
<h2>Taking Automation and Personalization to the Next Level</h2>
<p>While this is a fairly sophisticated approach to onboarding, Alex had even more goodness to share.</p>
<p>After using Vero for a while, he learned that he could integrate Vero with <a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>, unlocking an entirely new world of personalization that allowed him to make his customers feel truly at home.</p>
<blockquote><p>Zapier unlocked a whole new set of things I could do with Vero. It&rsquo;s a really, really powerful combination.</p></blockquote>
<p>In some of ContactMonkey&rsquo;s email campaigns, the call to action is simply to reply. They have found that this approach made it  very easy to setup product demos.</p>
<p><img width="782" class="example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/contact-monkey-demo-1.jpg" alt="contact monkey demo.jpg"></p>
<p>Alex wanted a way to ensure that the user received different (or no) emails if they had already replied to request a demo.</p>
<p>By linking Vero to Zapier, ContactMonkey could track replies and use them as triggers to turn off a campaign or kick off new ones &ndash; ensuring no customer ever gets the wrong email.</p>
<p class="block small-image" style="px"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/vero-and-contact-monkey-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Most importantly though, it means that every single customer interaction is tracked in one central place &ndash; Vero &ndash; enabling Alex to further provide each and every ContactMonkey customer with the best experience possible.</p>
<h2>Email Marketing or CRM?</h2>
<p>Alex took it one step further by leveraging Vero&rsquo;s personalization tools to reach out to new partners. There are weapons, then there&rsquo;s Alex.</p>
<p>Nearly all new Salesforce customers use an integration partner to customize the tool for their own business processes. These partners will often recommend other tools from the Salesforce AppExchange to help users gets more out of the software, like tracking the effectiveness of email for a sales team.</p>
<p>Following suit, Alex planned to contact a number of these partners to about recommending ContactMonkey to new Salesforce customers. But instead of writing each potential partner an email, he collected their contact information and uploaded it to Vero with tags and an event to trigger an email.</p>
<p><img width="782" class="example-email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/alex-outreach-email-1.jpg" alt="alex outreach email.jpg"></p>
<p>Using merge tags to include their first name and business name, he was able to send each a personalized email. By using Zapier to monitor responses, he essentially turned Vero into a CRM and made his life a lot easier in the process.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vero is probably the most important SaaS tool in our toolbox.&rdquo;<em>&ndash; Alex Smith, ContactMonkey</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I saved myself so much time. It would have taken me months to get through that list,&rdquo; Alex said.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours a day, Vero is listening for events, triggering emails, starting new campaigns and stopping others. Alex&rsquo;s story shows when it comes to marketing, Vero is the ultimate automation brain.</p>
<p>What will your story be?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Imagine if your product was an email newsletter.</p>
<p>Not a tool for selling or a channel for promoting but the actual product that people paid for. Would you treat email differently?</p>
<p><a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com/">Death to the Stock Photo</a> is an email-first startup. The product &ndash; monthly photo packs for creatives &ndash; arrives in the form of a remarkably beautiful email packed with images. But the images are just the beginning.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/110614005" width="800" height="341" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In July of 2013, photographers <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSherry36">David Sherry</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alliepal">Allie Lehman</a> realized they had piles of hard drives full of unused photos that were just sitting around. Both creatives, they also recognized a trend of expensive and subpar stock photography taking over the web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just started emailing people we knew and asked, &lsquo;Are these photos useful to you?'&rdquo; David says. The duo created a simple email newsletter in order to deliver their photos for free. To say the idea gained traction is an understatement.</p>
<p>David created an uncomplicated landing page that converted at nearly 50 percent. (The site has since been redesigned, but they <a href="http://join.deathtothestockphoto.com/">left the original landing page up</a> since it was so effective.)</p>

<p>Friends passed the word along and within six months, 20,000 creatives had joined the movement. David and Allie had given tons of value without asking for anything in return &ndash; and their endeavor had reached the point where it was time to find out if their community was willing to support their mission financially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months in, we tested a premium plan,&rdquo; says David. &ldquo;It was cobbled together but it allowed us to test the idea without actually building anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re building a sustainable culture of &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; in a world filled with &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hundred people signed up immediately, which validated their idea. With some revenue coming in and a number of lessons learned, they started building a simple but useful photo library for paid users.</p>

<p>They also used their new revenue stream to fund creative adventures like road trips and surfing expeditions. The photos from these trips helped grow their image library while empowering the creative community. Between David and Allie&rsquo;s photos and stories, as well as the Death to Stock Photo community, the couple is seeing between 15,000 and 20,000 new subscribers every month.</p>
<h2>Building a Business with Email</h2>
<p>When it comes to marketing, Death to Stock keeps it simple: <strong>the product is everything.</strong> But David, an experienced marketer, has a few strategies that keep new and existing users happy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com/">homepage</a>, for example, is a simple split-screen that asks visitors to sign up either for the free monthly newsletter or a paid subscription. David wants everyone to have a choice, which is why he keeps the opt-in above the fold.</p>

<p>Death to Stock incentivizes new users with the free monthly photo packs, but David makes a point to overdeliver with every email.</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of companies will say &lsquo;Join our list and get a free e-book.&rsquo; We don&rsquo;t say that. But when people sign up, we give them something free. It&rsquo;s a nice surprise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Including a free downloadable image in each email has been key to their list growth and user engagement. As David told us in our <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">massive email best practices guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Make conversion a habit.</p></blockquote>
<p>When subscribers are accustomed to getting value from each email you send, it&rsquo;s much more likely they&rsquo;ll be ready to upgrade when the time comes.</p>

<p>Doubling down on the user bonus strategy, Death to Stock sends active users more emails than inactive users, rewarding engagement with more photos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We segment based on hunger,&rdquo; says David. &ldquo;We know that when people engage a lot, they have a pain point. We relieve that by sending them more content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just free for the non-paying subscribers. &ldquo;Our secret is that we spend just as much time on free subscribers as we do premium subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if you&rsquo;re giving away free content, it should be held to a high standard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even with their enormous growth, David resists the temptation to send emails more than once a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just try to tune into our audience. We&rsquo;ve never paid attention to time or day,&rdquo; David says. &ldquo;Most email marketers will say you should email at least once a week. But we just do what feels right.&rdquo; <em><a href="http://ctt.ec/fTVi3" target="_blank">Tweet this</a></em></p>
<h2>What If Email Was Your Only Tool?</h2>
<p>If email was the foundation of your entire business, what would you do differently? Here are a few tips from a business that&rsquo;s earned more than 200,000 subscribers in 18 months:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Pare down your messaging.</strong> If you want people to take action, give them a single call to action. Too many buttons and links is distracting.</li>
<li><strong>Give it away.</strong> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to give without asking for anything in return. This is how relationships are formed.</li>
<li><strong>Use email to validate ideas.</strong> Before you build a product, use email to test the market. Read more about this on <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/43986871442/email-first-startups">Ryan Hoover&rsquo;s blog</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t oversend. </strong> Get to know your audience. It&rsquo;s better to be a rare gem than a commodity.</li>
<li><strong>Treat email like the product.</strong> In Death to Stock&rsquo;s case, email <em>is</em> the product. Regardless of what you sell, imagine that people pay for your emails; it will hone your focus on what really matters.</li>
</ul><p>How would you treat email if it were all you had? Let us know in the comments and be sure to check out <a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com/">Death to the Stock Photo</a>.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>How can TripAdvisor send emails nearly every day without getting labeled a spammer, while other businesses struggle to send even a monthly newsletter?</p>
<p>TripAdvisor, as I&rsquo;ve learned through my time as a customer and careful observer, has an unfair advantage. It&rsquo;s an advantage they created for themselves and one you can create too.</p>
<p>TripAdvisor has completely re-imagined the role email plays in their customer relationship management. It&rsquo;s largely a mindset change, followed by creative thinking and technical execution.</p>
<p>If you asked TripAdvisor, &ldquo;What time of day should I send my email newsletter?&rdquo; they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking the wrong question.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="simplePullQuote">
<p>&ldquo;Thousand-percent improvement requires rethinking problems entirely, exploring the edges of what&rsquo;s technically possible, and having a lot more fun in the process.&rdquo;<em><a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/" target="_blank">Steven Levy, Wired</a></em></p>
</div>
<p>If you want to improve your open rates by 10 percent, A/B test your subject line. If want to 10x your revenue, you need to blow the whole thing up. Just like TripAdvisor.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&rsquo;ll show you 20 emails from TripAdvisor. I&rsquo;ll note the behavior that triggered each email, the goal of each message and the key takeaways you can apply to your own business.</p>
<p>Prepare to completely rethink everything you know about email marketing.</p>

<div class="toc green"><a href="#14"><span class="number">Email #14 </span><span class="title">Warm and Fuzzy</span></a></div><br>
<div class="toc red"><a href="#15"><span class="number">Email #15 </span><span class="title">Double Duty</span></a></div><br>
<div class="toc gray-blue"><a href="#16"><span class="number">Email #16 </span><span class="title">Analytics</span></a></div><br>

<div class="toc blue"><a href="#19"><span class="number">Email #19 </span><span class="title">Holiday</span></a></div><br>
<div class="toc green"><a href="#20"><span class="number">Email #20 </span><span class="title">Monthly Report</span></a></div></p>
<p>As you read these emails, you&rsquo;ll notice an important trend &ndash; the messaging gets more personalized with every email. Each email is created and triggered as the result of <em>my</em> behavior on the TripAdvisor site and mobile app. No two TripAdvisor users will see the same emails.</p>
<p><strong>This is a lesson in momentum.</strong></p>
<p>TripAdvisor strings together a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/small-wins/">series of small wins</a> to net a huge win (i.e. a loyal tribe of active users). Between the first and last email, you&rsquo;ll notice a distinct change in the tone and content of the emails. There&rsquo;s no more guessing &ndash; TripAdvisor has me figured out.</p>
<div class="toc title blue" id="1"><h2><span class="number"> 1 </span><span class="title">The 'Toes-In-The-Water' Email</span></h2></div>
<p>This is one of the first emails I ever received from TripAdvisor. It&rsquo;s personalized a bit based on the little they know about me. I live Tucson, so they show me flight deals <em>from</em> Tucson and include some content about a contest they recently ran.</p>
<p>This is an introductory, toes-in-the-water email. TripAdvisor is inching their way into my life with a few simple calls to action. My reaction to it tells them a lot about my intentions and can help them shape the next message.</p>
<p>For example, clicking on the link to see flights from Tucson to Las Vegas is an indicator that I might be interested in traveling to Vegas. From here, they can show me hotels and attractions in Vegas. They&rsquo;ll even try to get an idea of when I&rsquo;m going so they can time their emails accordingly.</p>

<div class="toc title green" id="2"><h2><span class="number"> 2 </span><span class="title">The Peanut Butter Email</span></h2></div>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve never had mice in your house before, you might think that using cheese is a good way attract and trap mice. But once you&rsquo;ve actually experienced trapping mice, you know that it&rsquo;s peanut butter, not cheese, that draws them into your traps. A little knowledge goes a long way in solving your problem.</p>
<p>Between the first and second emails, I spend some time on TripAdvisor looking at hotels in Sedona, Ariz., a fairly clear sign that I have intentions to travel. As a direct result of that behavior, TripAdvisor put Sedona front and center in this email.</p>
<p>They know I don&rsquo;t want cheese, so they&rsquo;re enticing me with peanut butter.</p>
<blockquote><p>No matter how large we are, I always want to maintain a startup mentality.</p></blockquote>
<p class="annotation"><a href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-bussgang/scaling-is-hard-case-study-tripadvisor.html">Steve Kaufer, TripAdvisor Founder and CEO</a></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t give them <em>quite</em> enough data to be sure that I&rsquo;m heading to Sedona, so they also included links to other cities in the Southwest. They are one step closer to figuring out my plans. This email is another feeler and it could very well generate the data they need to send a strong call to action to actually book a hotel.</p>

<div class="toc title red" id="3"><h2><span class="number"> 3 </span><span class="title">The Eye Candy Email</span></h2></div>
<p>This email looks similar to the previous one. That&rsquo;s because TripAdvisor didn&rsquo;t get the data they need to send the email they want.</p>
<p>Instead, they&rsquo;re using their massive reservoir of content to get me moving. They need me on the site to accurately track behavior and intent. So while this email isn&rsquo;t very personalized, it has something else that&rsquo;s very important: <strong>eye candy</strong>.</p>
<p>Travel is inspiring. It makes people feel alive. TripAdvisor&rsquo;s entire business is built on that emotion (more on that soon). Their content strikes just the right tone and includes just the right eye candy to make people feel like they are wasting their life at a computer. They need to get <em>moving</em>.</p>
<p>They fuel the emotion, then satisfy it.</p>
<p>(Now <em>that</em> is what we call <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/education-to-activation/">bridging the gap</a>.)</p>

<div class="toc title gray-blue" id="4"><h2><span class="number"> 4 </span><span class="title">The 'It's Your Turn</span></h2></div>
<p><em>&ldquo;Jimmy, you&rsquo;re just 3 reviews away from your first badge.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Until now, TripAdvisor has been offering help. Now, they are asking for it.</p>
<p>This marks the beginning of an important transition in TripAdvisor&rsquo;s email marketing. They have enough data to safely assume that I&rsquo;ve actually visited some of the places I&rsquo;ve been researching. And now, instead of feeding me content (as a means to generate behavior and therefore data), they seek engagement. In just one email, TripAdvisor stopped marketing like a publisher and started marketing like a SaaS business.</p>
<p>This process parallels Nir Eyal&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-manufacture-desire.html">Hooked Method</a> almost perfectly. This stage is called &ldquo;Investment&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The last phase of the Hook is where the user is asked to do bit of work. The investment generally comes in the form of asking the user to give some combination of time, data, effort, social capital or money.</p></blockquote>
<p>TripAdvisor doubles down on the investment phase but framing my action as a social contribution. Rather than asking me help TripAdvisor, they are asking me to help my peers.</p>
<p>This is a lightbulb moment for the user: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reaping the rewards of other people&rsquo;s reviews so I should pay it forward by contributing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief value proposition and call to action, they list nearly every place and attraction I&rsquo;ve viewed since joining the site several months before. This makes it incredibly easy to recognize places I can contribute and actually write reviews.</p>

<div class="toc title orange" id="5"><h2><span class="number"> 5 </span><span class="title">The Abandonment Email</span></h2></div>
<p>This email is very similar to the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/airbnb/">Airbnb behavioral email</a> that I often refer to as the perfect email.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why I received this email:</p>
<ul><li>I browsed hotels in Thailand.</li>
<li>TripAdvisor asked me when I&rsquo;d be traveling, so I told them.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t book.</li>
</ul><p>As a result of that behavior, TripAdvisor triggered this email personalized with the hotels I looked at as well as additional hotels nearby and in the same price range. They know I&rsquo;m interested but they also know I haven&rsquo;t settled on a hotel yet.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a shopping cart abandonment email one step earlier in the buying cycle.</p>
<blockquote><p>For every success you see, we&rsquo;ve had plenty of items that we tested and didn&rsquo;t work out. You really never know what the next big thing will be.</p></blockquote>

<p>They use time and geography to personalize a very contextual email. Compare that to a simple newsletter. Are you starting to see the difference between 10 percent growth and 10x growth?</p>

<div class="toc title blue" id="7"><h2><span class="number"> 7 </span><span class="title">The Direct Response Email</span></h2></div>
<p>TripAdvisor has already established the notion that writing reviews gives back to the community. They send emails exactly like this one to active users on a regular basis.</p>
<p>These emails work because they are so simple and direct. Look at the copy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You researched several places on TripAdvisor recently. Did you end up going? If so, don&rsquo;t forget to add your reviews while your trip is fresh in your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don&rsquo;t assume anything, they simply remind users to get in the habit of leaving reviews.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing about this email is the subject line: &ldquo;Did you forget something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>TripAdvisor ever-so-gently implies that users have an obligation to write reviews since they have benefitted from other people&rsquo;s reviews.</p>

<div class="toc title green" id="8"><h2><span class="number"> 8 </span><span class="title">The Social Proof Email</span></h2></div>
<p>TripAdvisor takes social proof to a new level. Their Facebook integration means that I can see where my friends have traveled as well as their reviews, all in the name of engagement.</p>
<p>They actually use my Facebook friend&rsquo;s name in the subject line of this email &ndash; talk about personalization!</p>
<p>Think about the psychology at work here. TripAdvisor is using my friends&rsquo; contribution as a way to encourage me to contribute as well. The theme in these emails looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>We help you &gt; We help you &gt; We help you &gt; Okay, now you help us.</strong></p>

<div class="toc title red" id="9"><h2><span class="number"> 9 </span><span class="title">The 'Same Picture, Different Frame' Email</span></h2></div>
<p>Wait, haven&rsquo;t we already seen this email?</p>
<p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>One of the brilliant tactics TripAdvisor employs is to approach the same topic from different angles. In email #5, they sent a list of hotels that I&rsquo;d previously looked at. The subject line was <strong>&ldquo;Are you still interested in these hotels?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This is email is nearly identical with one important change &ndash; it&rsquo;s framed like a newsletter. Look at the first line of copy: <strong>&ldquo;This week&rsquo;s traveler advice for you.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>The emails have the same goal, same content and same layout but take a very different approach. It&rsquo;s a clever way for TripAdvisor to seek engagement without loading up the inbox with duplicate emails.</p>

<div class="toc title gray-blue" id="10"><h2><span class="number"> 10 </span><span class="title">The Milestone Email</span></h2></div>
<p>This is a perfect example of a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/behavioral-emails/#milestone">milestone email</a>.</p>
<p>Milestone emails reward good behavior and build on momentum. In this email, TripAdvisor makes a big deal about my first review. Take note of the copy, which emphasizes that my review is a contribution to the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see new reviewers join our travel community and help fellow travelers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don&rsquo;t waste any time asking me for another review. Momentum is key to engagement. TripAdvisor strikes while the iron is hot by providing a list of other places I&rsquo;ve researched and calls to action for each.</p>

<p>In our massive <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle email marketing guide</a>, there&rsquo;s a section on <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/lifecycle-marketing/behavioral-emails/#fake-transactional">Fake Transactional Emails</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing dishonest about these emails. The sender is smart enough to include so much context that the emails <em>feels</em> transactional even if it&rsquo;s clearly a lifecycle email.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what TripAdvisor has done here. The email is expected, so it&rsquo;s nearly guaranteed to be opened. And it makes the user feel good, so it&rsquo;s nearly guaranteed to be clicked. TripAdvisor has created a loop where customers enjoy their emails because of the context, not just the message.</p>

<div class="toc title purple" id="12"><h2><span class="number"> 12 </span><span class="title">The Spike Email</span></h2></div>
<p>Take a look at the date on this email. It was sent on the same day as the one above.</p>
<p>Why not just combine them into one email to reduce noise in the inbox? Two reasons:</p>
<ol><li><strong>One call to action is enough.</strong> The first email has no real call to action &ndash; it&rsquo;s intended to invoke emotion from the recipient &ndash; while the second has a strong call to action. You can&rsquo;t include both and reasonably expect people to convert. .</li>
<li><strong>TripAdvisor doesn&rsquo;t have to play by the rules.</strong> Any email marketing expert will tell you not to email people twice in a day. Unless, of course, you&rsquo;ve completely thrown out the rule book. TripAdvisor uses the first email as a foundation for the second one. It tees up the emotion and good feelings, then swoops in to turn those good vibes into engagement. The first email was an assist, this is the spike</li>
</ol><p>This isn&rsquo;t your grandma&rsquo;s marketing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a whole new way to think about email.</p>

<div class="toc title blue" id="13"><h2><span class="number"> 13 </span><span class="title">The Harley Davidson Email</span></h2></div>
<p>TripAdvisor is giving like-minded people a place to come for inspiration and identity. Here&rsquo;s Seth Godin on <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/11/inventing-a-tribe.html">creating tribes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were Harley-type renegades before there was Harley Davidson. There were digital nomads before there was Apple. There were pop music fans before there were the Beatles and Rastafarians before Marley.</p>
<p>Our job is to find the disconnected and connect them, to find people eager to pursue a goal and give them the structure to go achieve that goal. But just about always, we start with an already existing worldview, a point of view, a hunger that&rsquo;s waiting to be satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sending magnets to people who leave reviews is one way to create a tribe. People with TripAdvisor magnets on their car aren&rsquo;t active TripAdvisor users, they are thoughtful, inspired travelers.</p>

<p>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice in all of TripAdvisor&rsquo;s marketing is that they reward good behavior. Every engagement is an event worthy of a thank you note.</p>
<p>This email is one in a series of many that reinforces the notion of giving. The more I give, the more I&rsquo;m rewarded. It&rsquo;s a powerful cycle, and it&rsquo;s turned millions of would-be lurkers into contributors.</p>

<div class="toc title red" id="15"><h2><span class="number"> 15 </span><span class="title">The Double Duty Email</span></h2></div>
<p>From this point on, TripAdvisor starts including metrics in their emails to me. Data is on working overtime &ndash; they&rsquo;re using it as a trigger but also as content. The email stays true to their theme &ndash; making users feel really good about their association with TripAdvisor &ndash; but takes a quantitative approach.</p>
<p>The goal of this email is to <em>prove</em> to me that my contributions are valuable. What better way than hard data to make that case?</p>
<p>Take note of just how personalized this email is. The logic to send this message looks something like this:</p>
<p><em>Trigger [Top 10% email] when [user] writes more reviews than 90% of [all users] in [Tucson] within [7 days].</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty different than queuing up one newsletter for an entire list. It&rsquo;s a serious investment in data and triggers. But now that the investment is made, brilliant emails like this are automated. They are triggered at just the right time for every user.</p>
<p>You want to 10x your business? Start thinking this big.</p>

<div class="toc title blue-gray" id="16"><h2><span class="number"> 16 </span><span class="title">The Analytics Email</span></h2></div>
<p>It&rsquo;s would easy to explain to users <em>why</em> writing more reviews is helpful to other travelers but TripAdvisor lets the data do the talking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In only 7 days, your reviews have had 107 readers</strong></p>
<p>Travelers really love your latest reviews.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re just 3 reviews away from your Senior Reviewer badge. Keep going!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The copy is upbeat, positive and encouraging. When you get this email, it actually feels like you&rsquo;re being called to duty. It makes you feel like your knowledge is valuable and others could really benefit from it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true, of course, and TripAdvisor does an excellent job communicating that message in as few words as possible.</p>

<div class="toc title orange" id="17"><h2><span class="number"> 17 </span><span class="title">The Small Win Email</span></h2></div>
<p>Tip #6 in our <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/#6">email marketing best practices guide</a> is &ldquo;Make conversion a habit.&rdquo; The idea is that even small conversions grow your relationship with each and every user.</p>
<p>David Sherry from <a href="http://deathtothestockphoto.com/">Death to the Stock Photo</a> includes a download in every email. Brian Dean from <a href="http://backlinko.com">Backlinko</a> asks people to reply to this emails. TripAdvisor asks people to add reviews.</p>
<p>If people are used to engaging with your emails and getting value as a result, it will be much easier to ask for bigger commitments down the road.</p>

<div class="toc title purple" id="18"><h2><span class="number"> 18 </span><span class="title">The Notification Email</span></h2></div>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/small-wins/">Small Win email</a>. These emails are designed to:</p>
<ul><li>Introduce people to features or products</li>
<li>Build trusting relationships with content</li>
<li>Start a real, genuine conversation</li>
<li>Build momentum towards a bigger goal</li>
</ul><p>In this case, TripAdvisor uses a notification email to remind me about Facebook integration. In fact, every time one of my Facebook friends joins TripAdvisor, I get an email about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why are you emailing me? If you can&rsquo;t tell me in six words what you need me to do, it&rsquo;s unlikely I&rsquo;ll be able to guess.</p></blockquote>

<p>You might say this is just an excuse to send another email but it&rsquo;s actually a valuable opportunity to get users exploring new areas of the site. Now that I can see where my friends have traveled, I will likely discover new places I want to visit as well, further deepening my reliance on TripAdvisor.</p>

<p>This is one of the smartest emails I&rsquo;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>This email &ndash; the monthly report &ndash; has it all. It&rsquo;s behavioral, it&rsquo;s completely personalized, it&rsquo;s data-driven, it&rsquo;s gamified and it has a strong call to action.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s framed as a report but it&rsquo;s designed specifically to be an engagement tool. No one is more clever than TripAdvisor when it comes to attacking one call to action from many angles.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s loaded with every best practice in the book, this email is actually really simple. Every SaaS product has data on their users. TripAdvisor has simply collected a few key data points and added context. And the result is something really special.</p>

<p>To what can we attribute Amazon&rsquo;s growth? After all, they have access to the same tools, people, software and infrastructure as every other retailer. The answer is simple, but trickles down into every nook and cranny of the business: <strong>Amazon is built on a culture of innovation</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2013, Amazon spent <a href="http://www.bryaneisenberg.com/amazons-performance-secrets/">$6.5 billion on research and development</a>. It&rsquo;s an impressive sum but just five percent of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/Fy%202015%20R&amp;D.pdf">federal government&rsquo;s annual R&amp;D spend</a>. It&rsquo;s fair to say that an investment in R&amp;D doesn&rsquo;t equate to innovation. The key to innovation isn&rsquo;t money &hellip; it&rsquo;s a willingness to test relentlessly, fail often and improvise quickly.</p>
<p>At Amazon, innovation is bred into every facet of the business, from the top down. Here&rsquo;s a snippet of Bezos&rsquo; view on innovation from a 2011 shareholder call:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you invent frequently and are willing to fail, then you never get to that point where you really need to bet the whole company. [Amazon Web Services] also started about six or seven years ago. We are planting more seeds right now, and it is too early to talk about them, but we are going to continue to plant seeds. And I can guarantee you that everything we do will not work. And, I am never concerned about that. <strong>We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Stubborn on Vision, Flexible on Details</h2>
<p>The purpose of this guide isn&rsquo;t to praise Amazon. Rather, it&rsquo;s to examine the practical implications of their innovation in action, specifically with their email marketing.</p>
<p>In the average marketing department, email marketing relies heavily on promotional messaging and newsletters. Coupons, sales and content sent to massive lists of customers and prospects, occasionally segmented by purchase history is a shot in the dark.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that great copy and strong calls to action can&rsquo;t work &ndash; they often do &ndash; but, at best, they are only speaking to a small percentage of the recipients.</p>
<p>Amazon takes an entirely different approach. Every email is personalized using every scrap of information they have about their users: on-site behavior, past purchases, amount spent, location, age, gender, etc.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="300px"><img data-attachment-id="4788" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/guides/the-amazon-experience/personalization-email-marketing/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/personalization-email-marketing.jpg?fit=620%2C378&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="620,378" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="personalization-email-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/personalization-email-marketing.jpg?fit=300%2C183&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/personalization-email-marketing.jpg?fit=620%2C378&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-4788 size-medium " src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/personalization-email-marketing-300x182.jpg" alt="personalization-email-marketing" width="300" height="182"></p>
<p>Instead of pulling random examples from our inbox to show you, we created a new Amazon account, made a few purchases and started collecting emails. What we found was really interesting, and really impressive. Below, you&rsquo;ll find the emails we received along with the context of their arrival (our behavior, purchases, etc.). It&rsquo;s a study in <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/">email-done-right</a> and a template that other business can use send the right emails, at the right time, every time.</p>
<h2>The Amazon Email Experience</h2>
<p>The Amazon experience isn&rsquo;t beautiful, it&rsquo;s functional. A company like Apple invests time in aesthetics while a company like Amazon invests time in efficiency. The entire shopping experience is streamlined from top to bottom.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2rEW4KFqHZc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>When it comes to email, Amazon doesn&rsquo;t waste any time with &ldquo;blasts&rdquo;. They do, however, have templates that can be personalized based on behavior. And the longer you are a customer, the more data they have.</p>

<p>Since Amazon doesn&rsquo;t know much about me yet, there isn&rsquo;t a ton of personalization they can do. They offer a brief overview of their services and show me where to find a few key bits of information about my account. The call to action &ndash; that bold, yellow button &ndash; is clear and unintimidating.</p>
<blockquote><p>The common question that gets asked in business is, why? That&rsquo;s a good question, but an equally valid question is, why not?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Amazon has included a some information that isn&rsquo;t vital to a new user but could very well drive engagement, and therefore create more data. They lead with customer support, then mention their best product, the Kindle, the availability of digital content, plug their mobile app and link to Twitter and Facebook. (Remember, you can actually make purchases on Amazon via Twitter.)</p>
<p>This email is transactional in nature but there&rsquo;s so much more to it. Amazon has sent more than 200 million welcome emails and, clearly, they have narrowed down the copy and content that gets people using their website and making purchases as fast as possible. The subtle addition of marketing to a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/">transactional email</a> is low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p>Email receipts <strong>need</strong> just one thing: utility. They are designed to pass on necessary information about a purchase that a customer can keep for their records.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/growth-hacking-with-email-receipts/" target="_blank">takes receipts a step further</a> with some additional functionality. Take, for example, the links in this email. They are <strong>deep</strong>. Clicking the order number takes you directly to the order, where you can track it, write reviews or buy another one. (My dog loved this, I&rsquo;ll definitely be getting more.)</p>
<blockquote><p>We can afford to focus on smaller and smaller defects and eliminate them at their root. That reduces cost, because things just work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just under the product name, there are links to share on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. And why not? It&rsquo;s unlikely that too many customers do this but when you send millions of receipts per year, Amazon can turn it&rsquo;s customers into salespeople. Social proof is, of course, one of the key drivers of sales on Amazon.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also notice that Amazon includes a link titled &ldquo;Your Recommendations&rdquo;. This signals the beginning of data collection. Clicking that link takes me to a page of recommended products, created dynamically just for me.</p>

<p>This email is nearly identical to the receipt except that the button links directly to the tracking information rather than the order receipt.</p>
<p>No need to break this email down in the same detail we did above, but we do need to ask one question: How effective must this email be if Amazon chooses to send nearly the same content and calls to action twice?</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Thanks for making a purchase Amazon. Here are a bunch of ways to make lots more purchases, on every device and platform.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s essentially what this email says but Amazon does a nice job presenting it as a resource for new shoppers. Let&rsquo;s take a look at all the things they plug:</p>
<ul><li>Amazon Prime: Pay an annual fee for two-day shipping and other membership benefits</li>
<li>Amazon Mobile App: Shop from your smartphone</li>
<li>Gold Box: Amazon&rsquo;s take on Groupon. Get deals on products, downloads and even events in your local area.</li>
<li>Subscribe &amp; Save: Subscribe to any product (I do this with dog food) and Amazon will automate the purchase each month.</li>
<li>Kindle: Read (and <strong>buy</strong>) books</li>
<li>Fire Tablets: Amazon&rsquo;s iPad competitor, also loaded with ways to make purchases</li>
<li>Amazon Fire TV: Similar to Roku and Apple TV, it allows users to access digital content via their Prime membership</li>
<li>Fire Phone: Smartphone that comes with a Prime membership and enhanced Amazon customer support</li>
<li>Facebook: Stay up-to-date on deals</li>
<li>Twitter: Add items to your Amazon Wishlist with a hashtag</li>
</ul><p>The email is <em>clearly</em> promotional but I&rsquo;ve been an Amazon customer for years and wasn&rsquo;t aware of all these things. It&rsquo;s genuinely useful information. Not too many companies welcome customers this way but if you offer more than one service, why not introduce new folks to the rest of your business?</p>

<p>Perhaps because I&rsquo;ve made a purchase within just a few days of signing up for a new account, Amazon wants to strike while the iron is hot. In this email, they invite me to join a site called MyHabit.com that curates deals for clothing and other fashion products.</p>
<p>There are two things I find especially interesting about this email:</p>
<h3>1. There&rsquo;s a clear trend</h3>
<p>Within five days of opening the account, I made two purchases.</p>
<ul><li>October 21: Open account</li>
<li>October 23: Purchase #1</li>
<li>October 26: Purchase #2</li>
<li>October 31: Invitation to MyHabit.com</li>
</ul><p>My purchasing behavior is trending upward. They&rsquo;ve had to do very little to entice me to buy. They see this as a signal that I&rsquo;m ready to spend and are trying to built a habit of frequent purchasing.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we&rsquo;ve stuck with for 18 years, and they&rsquo;re the reason we&rsquo;re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Nir Eyal, author of <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/hooked">Hooked</a>, frequency is the fastest way to build a new habit.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a recent study at the University College London, researchers followed participants as they attempted to form a habit of flossing their teeth. As one of its findings, the study concluded that the more frequently the new behavior occurred, the stronger the habit. Like flossing, frequent engagement with a web site or app increases the likelihood of forming new habits.</p></blockquote>

<h3>2. There&rsquo;s demographic data at work</h3>
<p>The email and the site features men&rsquo;s clothing and photos of men around my age. When I click &ldquo;Show Now&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m taken to the Men&rsquo;s page, not the homepage. This page also features sharp-looking guys in their late 20&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>MyHabit.com is selling me a better version of myself, and they&rsquo;ve built it directly into the email.</p>

<p>Americans spent $55 billion on their pets <a href="http://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp">in 2013</a>. Naturally, Amazon identifies me as a pet owner as a result of my purchase history and expects that I will be spending more money on <a href="http://instagram.com/p/sDfmS7JP_K/" target="_blank">my dog</a>.</p>
<p>I love this email because it&rsquo;s so direct. Essentially, it saying <em>&ldquo;You know you need stuff for your dog, you might as well save some money on it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<blockquote><p>We can&rsquo;t be in survival mode. We have to be in growth mode.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bold, clear button makes it obvious what to do next. Behind that button is a sea of pet supplies &hellip; everything from food and carriers to leashes and toys. This is an instance where it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for the recipient to spend much time in the email. The experience is behind the button, the email just needs to focus on spurring a click.</p>

<p>Most of the emails that we&rsquo;ve looked at so far were either transactional and or highly personalized for me. This email is different since 1) nearly every e-commerce business sends Black Friday emails and 2) Amazon likely send this same email to every customer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this is that copy is kept to a bare minimum. In fact, they don&rsquo;t even use full sentences. All you really need to know is:</p>
<ul><li>Black Friday is coming</li>
<li>We have deals</li>
<li>See them here</li>
</ul><p>Done.</p>
<p>The only distraction here is the plug for Amazon Prime, which brings with it some context. If you are going to shop online during the holidays, you need gifts to arrive on time. Prime guarantees that can happen so it&rsquo;s a logical place to inset a call to action for customers to learn more about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Maintain a firm grasp of the obvious at all times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also of interest, once I clicked this email I started seeing retargeting ads in my Facebook feed. Black Friday is a big deal &ndash; consumers spent $59 billion <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-27/chart-what-black-fridays-59-billion-really-tells-us">last year</a> &ndash; and Amazon is all in.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the first thing you check when you are looking at a product on Amazon? The reviews, of course.</p>
<p>Social proof isn&rsquo;t a new concept but Amazon is the first to prioritize and scale it. Every time a purchase is made, Amazon asks the customers for feedback. The feedback, in turn, helps other customers make smart purchases, creating a better customer experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Not in the email above that Amazon is very specific about the feedback they want.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;How did the size large fit?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simply clicking the appropriate review automatically adds data to the the product page:</p>

<p>The user is brought to a page where they can leave a review and give the product a star rating. Amazon has been able to scale this process because people are helping each other, and Amazon benefits as a by-product.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is that some people leave hilarious reviews and Amazon actually keeps track of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1001250201">the most hilarious reviews</a> here.</p>

<p>There are, of course, some downsides to all this data. For example, when you indulge a guilty pleasure by looking at Halloween customers for your dog, only to be reminded about it later in an email.</p>
<p>I never thought someone would ask me, <em>&ldquo;Are you looking for something in our Pet Apparel department?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>(We&rsquo;ve <a href="https://blog.getvero.com/revamped-content-strategy/">committed to being transparent</a> on the Vero blog, even if it&rsquo;s cringeworthy.)</p>
<p>Did you know that you could dress your dog up as a pumpkin, peacock or orca? This email is fabulous for the entertainment value alone but it&rsquo;s also data-driven. I did indeed search for a Halloween costume for my dog, so they have quantitative evidence that I should be interested in the products displayed here. It comes at the just the right time in the buying cycle since I&rsquo;ve expressed clear interest but haven&rsquo;t made a purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you never want to be criticized, for goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t do anything new.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice also that Amazon avoids using copy like &ldquo;Buy Now&rdquo; or &ldquo;Add to Cart&rdquo;. The copy on the buttons is <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-calls-to-action/">friction free</a>. The idea is to move people to the next step, not seal the deal right here in the email.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure my dog will love her new orca costume.<br>
Obviously Amazon sends many more emails than the nine we&rsquo;ve highlighted here. Hopefully this post gives you an idea of their approach. By using the data you already have, and inserting simple messaging at the right places in the buying cycle, you can dramatically increase sales, engagement, pageviews or whichever metric you&rsquo;re after.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the most enlightening thing about Amazon&rsquo;s approach to email?</strong></p></body></html>
