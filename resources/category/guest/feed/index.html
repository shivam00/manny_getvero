				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Australia&rsquo;s love affair with online shopping is a gift that keeps on giving. While more than a quarter of us shop online once a week, we&rsquo;re shunning overseas sites in growing numbers, preferring to spend our cash on domestic sites. Indeed, 79 percent of Australians who shop online mostly spend their cash on local websites.</p>
<p>Some online shoppers are explicitly seeking out local merchants to mitigate some of the risks, ensure friendly return policies and guarantee quality goods; for other shoppers, it&rsquo;s all about supporting local retailers.</p>
<p>This is great news for local merchants who are willing to capitalise on the preference for shopping locally.</p>
<p>Many emerging Australian startups are dedicated to making online shopping an easier process and are creating opportunities for businesses to bolster their sales. Here are five innovative ideas to consider in 2014.</p>
<p><span id="more-2454"></span></p>
<h2>1. Optimise Your Product Display</h2>
<p>Quicker than ever before, online shoppers are making decisions about what they like and don&rsquo;t like, switching across websites in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>By offering a 3D display of your digital range, Aussie e-commerce innovator <a href="http://thereitis.com/" target="_blank">Thereitis 3D Display</a> can visually engage shoppers and bring your items to life.</p>
<p>The Adelaide startup has created cutting-edge technology that uses our human ability to skim through images quickly and optimises keyword search, category and price filters to make shopping online even easier.</p>
<p>It works particularly well with mobile devices, where users tend to navigate the screen using touch instead of mouse clicks.</p>
<p>The technology allows customers to more comprehensively judge products before purchase. As an example, the 3D technology increased conversion rates for a pendant on gifts.com by seven times.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://thereitis.com/" target="_blank">Thereitis</a>, and watch the video below.</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/22IJCF7YS8I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>2. Increase Trust Levels</h2>
<p>Imagine allowing your customers to touch your online products before paying for them, without risking broken or lost inventory.inventory.</p>
<p>Sydney startup <a href="http://www.touchpayments.com.au/" target="_blank">Touch Payments</a> promises that customers won&rsquo;t ever have to pay for a product they haven&rsquo;t touched &acirc;&#128;&#148; a major bonus for promoting the concept of secure online shopping.</p>
<p>When shoppers choose Touch Payments at checkout, there are no credit card details to enter (no extra forms to fill out, no traditional credit checks) and nothing to pay at the time of purchase. Instead, customers are invoiced for their orders and receive their merchandise before having to make a payment.</p>
<p>Once an order ships, shoppers have up to 16 days (no interest or other fees) to pay the invoice through any of the following payment options: BPAY, bank transfer, credit card, debit card or even cash at Australia Post. Touch Payments assumes the risk, which means Touch always pays the merchant, no matter what.</p>
<p>By mitigating risk and offering quality assurance to even the most sceptical browsers, Touch Payments offers an increased trust level and a greater conversion rate for your shop. Delayed payment has increased conversion rates by up to 30 percent overseas.</p>
<p>As the first startup of its kind in Australia, Touch wants to show you how you can benefit. Get in <a href="http://www.touchpayments.com.au/" target="_blank">Touch</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Reinvent Delivery</h2>
<p>In a market obsessed with speedy delivery times, consumers expect their purchases to arrive almost instantly. This year, market-savvy merchants will enhance their sites with <a href="http://parcelpoint.com.au/" target="_blank">ParcelPoint</a>, a solution that addresses the problem of missed deliveries.</p>
<p>ParcelPoint partners with couriers to allow consumers to direct their parcels to a nearby shop within a network of stores, from news agents to convenience stores, which will hold a parcel until the customer is ready to collect it, seven days a week.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a convenient solution for people who don&rsquo;t want purchases delivered to their homes or work or who are unavailable during regular 9-5 delivery times.</p>
<p>Some retail partners only use the service to facilitate fast returns, because returns don&rsquo;t require changes to the retailer&rsquo;s e-management system.</p>
<p>ParcelPoint has over 1,000 pick-up locations and is worth investigating as a way to provide more convenience to your customers.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://parcelpoint.com.au/" target="_blank">ParcelPoint</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Introduce Alternative Payment Options</h2>
<p>Melbourne startup <a href="https://www.coinjar.com/" target="_blank">CoinJar</a> is another newcomer that is shaking things up in the e-commerce space.</p>
<p>In response to the recent boom in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> transactions, CoinJar&rsquo;s young founders identified a gap in the market for an easy-to-use digital wallet for buying, selling and accept bitcoin as a merchant. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that avoids having to pay bank fees and absorb exchange-rate losses.</p>
<p>With more than 20,000 Aussie users, both Bitcoin and CoinJar make it easier to purchase goods online.</p>
<p>CoinJar eases the way for merchants to start accepting bitcoin payments and offers solutions that allow buyers to use the currency. It&rsquo;s cheaper than accepting credit card payment: The retailer&rsquo;s fee is 1.1 percent per transaction.</p>
<p>Given that CoinJar offers complete security when making digital payments, these sorts of applications to your site could give Australians looking for alternatives to PayPal and other established methods a virtual nudge into the online world.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.coinjar.com/" target="_blank">CoinJar</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Use Social to Sell</h2>
<p>Finding customers where they already are is a massive advantage.</p>
<p>U.S. startup <a href="http://new.soldsie.com/landing/" target="_blank">Soldsie</a> allows you to sell directly, via social media. By simply commenting on a picture posted on your fan page, your customer has the opportunity to order straight from your online shop by logging on to Facebook or Instagram.</p>
<p>Soldsie manages the process and makes it simple so that merchants wanting to take the headache out of selling on social media can focus on existing e-commerce channels and directly monetise social media followers.</p>
<p>Best of all, Soldsie now treats spam comments as regular comments, meaning they will be parsed without any additional work on your part.</p>
<p>Comments create conversion rates of four times more than links, and Soldsie claims that use of Soldsie has increased sales by a whopping 300 percent for its merchant partners.</p>

<html><body><p>Every day, we receive more email than we&rsquo;ll ever open. At some point, it seemed like a good idea to sign up for a particular mailing list or subscribe to a favorite group&rsquo;s updates. But the flow of email rarely slows, so most of us are picky about what we actually open and read. If you want your firm&rsquo;s email to be a part of the inbox in crowd, you need an <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-guide/campaign-strategy/">email marketing strategy</a> that takes into account who your recipients are and what they&rsquo;re looking for and allows you to tailor your content to them.</p>
<p>Consider this: 60 percent of marketers say that <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-statistics/">email is currently producing a positive ROI</a>; an additional 32 percent believe email marketing will eventually produce a positive ROI. These numbers are difficult to ignore.</p>
<p><span id="more-2434"></span></p>
<p>First up, let&rsquo;s talk about the quality of your list. Contact lists are for sale, and you can buy them at your discretion to include in your email marketing. But it&rsquo;s better to grow your own contacts organically. Someone who has responded to an offer, subscribed to your blog or downloaded content from your site in the past is much more likely to use your services in the future. Take the time and money you would use to purchase email lists and instead create white papers, e-books and other downloadable content that will encourage visitors to offer their email addresses.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that it&rsquo;s best to keep your email schedule fairly regular &acirc;&#128;&#148; and it&rsquo;s better to err on the side of often so that you stay on your prospects&rsquo; radar. To some extent, though, your content will drive your time line. After all, there&rsquo;s no point in sending an email with no content &acirc;&#128;&#148; or, possibly worse, subpar content. Here are some good benchmarks for when to hit send:</p>
<ul><li><strong>To announce new content.</strong> Develop a <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/epic-content-marketing-how-to/">content marketing strategy</a> and then follow it! This means producing guides and white papers, maybe even video content. If you want recipients to actually open your emails, you have to give them a reason. Offering them an education is a great way to do this. The next time the people on your list are singling out emails to trash, they&rsquo;ll remember the value of your content and keep you out of the trash.</li>
<li><strong>To promote webinars.</strong> Like content, there&rsquo;s value here: things to learn and networks to grow. Because your audience cared enough to get on your mailing list, there&rsquo;s a good chance a significant number of them will attend your webinar. Not only do you get to present your topic, but you also have the chance to listen to the issues that your prospects bring to the virtual table &acirc;&#128;&#148; and listening goes a long way in creating loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>To make hard offers.</strong> Start a conversation. Send your list an offer for a free consultation or something similar &acirc;&#128;&#148; something with value. This is your chance to shine. Remember, this isn&rsquo;t about a sales pitch; this is simply sharing. If you push too hard, you risk the relationship. Show them what you&rsquo;re capable of and that you&rsquo;re willing to put in the time to learn about the issues they&rsquo;re facing.</li>
</ul><p>These sorts of events are content/offer dependent, so it&rsquo;ll be up to you and/or your partner agencies to produce content or create the deals that you&rsquo;re emailing about. But there are other mailworthy reasons for reaching out that can fill in the empty spaces between content generation:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Social media aggregation.</strong> Remember, not all content has to be yours. Pull together your favorite content from around the Web, preferably related to your services or industry. This will keep your leads informed and will keep your firm top of mind as a thought leader. In essence, you become the gatekeeper to your industry&rsquo;s trends.</li>
<li><strong>Blog subscription.</strong> Not everyone on your list, including those who signed up through your blog, will be familiar with every post. Pull some favorites and share links to them. Package related posts together. Make your email marketing strategy all about educating your prospects. Doing so will likely grow the number of subscribers to your blog and will once again promote your role as a thought leader in your industry. You&rsquo;ll be building the trust and familiarity that business relationships thrive on.</li>
</ul><p>Keep in mind as you develop an email marketing strategy that it&rsquo;s not a substitute for other means of traffic generation, like SEO or content creation. Rather, it&rsquo;s a means of developing your larger online marketing strategy. <em>Email isn&rsquo;t the content you&rsquo;re sharing &acirc;&#128;&#148; it&rsquo;s one of the ways you share content.</em> But because a solid email marketing strategy is built, first and foremost, around people and firms that have already reached out to you in some way &acirc;&#128;&#148; and are on your mailing list for a reason &acirc;&#128;&#148; it can be one of the most powerful ways to nurture leads and grow your business. The relationship is already there. Nurture it with the proper content, share your insights and build trust and you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to turning those relationships into new business for your firm.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Email is an easy, cost-effective and personal channel that can help you <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/retention-email-inspiration">improve customer retention</a>. In fact, 59% of B2B marketers believe email marketing is still the <b>most effective channel</b> in generating revenue.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s easy &ndash; because it&rsquo;s personal and trackable. Chris validates this idea with his post on five killer examples of companies <a href="http://blog.crazyegg.com/2013/03/20/examples-retention-emails/">using email to retain customers</a>.</p>
<p>Most commonly, email is used by marketer&rsquo;s as part of their <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/customer-acquisition/">customer acquisition</a> arsenal but today I want to provide you with some other ideas of what you can use email for. Too many marketers are spending bucket loads of money acquiring new customers&hellip;only to let them slide away with poorly executed, or non-existent, <a href="http://blog.clientheartbeat.com/9-customer-retention-strategies-for-msps/">customer retention strategies</a>.</p>
<p>This post aims to prove to you how important it is to start using email as a channel to <b>increase customer retention</b>, using practical examples.</p>
<p>According to research conducted by Howard Feirertag and John Hogan, the most common reason why businesses lose customers is through <b>lack of customer contact and relationship building</b> (in fact, this accounts for 67% of lost customers).</p>
<p><i>That&rsquo;s an </i><i>insane</i><i> percentage.</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately it&rsquo;s true &ndash; businesses are not doing enough to keep in contact with their customers, and that&rsquo;s leading to a decline in customer retention rates.</p>
<p>So, here are some good ideas on how to use email in your <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/customer-retention/">customer retention</a> strategies:</p>
<p><span id="more-955"></span></p>
<h2><b>1. Use email to stay in contact with customers</b></h2>
<p><a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> does a great job of staying in contact with their customers using email. I signed up for Mixpanel in May and since then I&rsquo;ve received four emails from them. The first email was a helpful getting started checklist. The second was a personal invite to attend their latest webinar. The third email was another personal email from Will (the Solutions Architect at Mixpanel) and, most recently, they emailed me a quick feature update with some of their latest announcements.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of one of the emails I received.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="513px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png"><img data-attachment-id="956" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/improve-your-customer-retention/mixpanel-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?fit=513%2C461&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="513,461" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mixpanel-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?fit=300%2C270&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?fit=513%2C461&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png" alt="mixpanel-email" width="513" height="461" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?w=513&amp;ssl=1 513w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?resize=300%2C270&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?resize=111%2C100&amp;ssl=1 111w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?resize=50%2C45&amp;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/mixpanel-email.png?resize=75%2C67&amp;ssl=1 75w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple, engaging and adds value to my experience with their product. On top of having had a good experience with the Mixpanel product at our company <a href="https://www.clientheartbeat.com">Client Heartbeat</a> these emails have helped us feel as though we have a good relationship with the company, <i>even though we  have </i><i>never</i><i> reached out to them with any support questions</i>.</p>
<p>This shows just how effective email can be at engaging your customers and staying in contact with them. Mixpanel use email as a medium to push personal and informative messages, leading to an increase in their customers&rsquo; investment in their product. This goes a long way toward building a strong sense of customer loyalty.</p>
<h2><b>2. Use email to send personalized messages to specific groups of customers</b></h2>
<p>Are you sick of waking up to five completely impersonalized emails every morning?</p>
<p>I bet you are.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a typical scenario: you get a series of three email from a company you just signed up to explaining how to add contacts to their system <b>despite the fact</b> that you have already added contacts yesterday and have everything set up.</p>
<p>You can do better. It&rsquo;s not difficult to track your customers&rsquo; actions and send more relevant emails (or no emails at all, if that provides a better user experience!)</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="http://getvero.com">Vero</a> help this process by triggering emails only when a customer takes a specific action inside your app, on your website or when browsing your eCommerce store. This way, you can make sure the emails you are sending are personalized and relevant.</p>
<p>At Client Heartbeat we have used marketing automation to help send personalized messages to specific groups of customers. Unfortunately, the tool we initially used didn&rsquo;t give us enough flexibility and as a result we experienced first hand how bad things can get when you send your customers irrelevant emails. I even received a couple of complaints from existing customers who, somehow, were getting my <b>sales</b> emails!</p>
<p>YUCK. There is no doubt that one of the fastest ways to lose a customer is to send them irrelevant sales emails.</p>
<p>ToutApp is another tool you should consider to help alleviate this pain point. It has some nifty automation tools for targeting leads pre-signup and one of it&rsquo;s best features is the ability to segment and create &acirc;&#128;&#156;groups of customers.&acirc;&#128;&#157; At Client Heartbeat we&rsquo;re able to segment our customers by country and by other industry-specific segmentation criteria. ToutApp lets me send an email to each segment helping keep things super personalized but also making it quick and easy to send emails with this sort of relevance.</p>
<p>Want some ideas on how to segment customers, check out these <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/three-killer-examples-of-segmentation-in-email-marketing/">examples of killer email marketing segmentation.</a></p>
<h2>3. Use email to send friendly reminders</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2013/04/5-email-marketing-strategies-for-customer-retention.html">Jana Fung of MixRank</a> recommends sending a reminder email whenever there is a major marketing event going on in your customer&rsquo;s geographic location.</p>
<p>One company that does this well is InfusionSoft. They are hosting an &acirc;&#128;&#156;Infusioncon&acirc;&#128;&#157; event in Sydney later this year and, as a way to inform me (an existing customer), they popped up a promotional banner on the first page after logging in. This popup was also backed up by an email. Both were targeted to me, as an Australian.</p>
<p>In a world where lots of us build customer relationships via email and never actual meet face to face, it&rsquo;s always refreshing to be invited to a live event.</p>
<p>The benefit of sending friendly reminders about events or other marketing activities is that it shows your customers that you really care about them. This is even truer if you use targeting: after all, you went out of your way to make sure they received an invite.</p>
<p>Other examples of situations when you could send friendly reminders include:</p>
<ul><li>When a renewal is due</li>
<li>When an invoice is ready</li>
<li>When an upcoming webinar or blog post has been published (that&rsquo;s relevant)</li>
<li>When special promotions are available to customers</li>
<li>When you are hosting a new webinar</li>
<li>When you put up a new resource</li>
</ul><h2>4. Use email to send special promotions to customers</h2>
<p>Special promotions or discounts are a great way to encourage existing customers to make repeat purchases. Email is a common channel to use when sending out these promotions to customers. Remember to use an email marketing tool that lets you send promotions based on specific segmentation or actions your customers take (see point two above!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.proflowers.com">ProFlowers</a> uses email to send promotions to customers who can take advantage of events happening in the near future, like Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an email I got from ProFlowers &ndash; they&rsquo;ve been really smart and included my girlfriend&rsquo;s name! They knew I sent her flowers a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>This is a great example of using targeted email to send special promotions.

<h2>5. Use email to send customer feedback surveys</h2>
<p>Customer feedback gives you the intelligence and actionable data to improve your product and marketing and increase customer retention.</p>
<p>Without knowing how your customers feel about your service you can&rsquo;t make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Email is an effective channel to get feedback from your customers. Here are three benefits of using email to send customer feedback surveys:</p>
<ul><li><b>Email is trackable:</b> You can see who opens the emails, who responds and who needs following up.</li>
</ul><ul><li><b>Email gets instant feedback:</b> Email allows for quick feedback, so you can quickly act on any problems and implement processes to stop them from happening again.</li>
<li><b>Email can be automated:</b> Manually doing customer surveys can take forever; email helps you automate the process so you can spend your time doing the things you do best.<b> </b></li>
</ul><p>Mimi Tan, Operations Managers at <a href="http://rgtechnologies.com.au">R&amp;G Technologies</a>, uses ClientHeartbeat to send out her customer feedback surveys every quarter. Since Client Heartbeat automates the process, she actually doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything; it just sends the surveys out automatically from her personal email address, on her behalf.</p>
<p>It then intelligently sends notifications when customer feedback has been received and when the system flags unhappy customers as <b>&acirc;&#128;&#156;at risk&acirc;&#128;&#157; </b>of cancelling or leaving.</p>
<p>If you want to get into the details on how to structure a good feedback survey over email, check out this guide on <a href="https://www.clientheartbeat.com/resources/customer-feedback-survey-guide">how to create a good customer feedback survey</a>.</p>
<h2>6. Use email to create personal, one-to-one relationships with customers</h2>
<p>With the rise of marketing automation more and more companies are using email to automate their messages in bulk.</p>
<p>Many of these messages are poorly thought out, don&rsquo;t use enough segmentation, are image-heavy and fall into the &acirc;&#128;&#152;same-old&rsquo; bucket. This is having a significant impact on people&rsquo;s inboxes and making it harder and harder for us, as marketers, to get our messages across.</p>
<p>With Gmail recently releasing <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/a-new-inbox-that-puts-you-back-in.html">a new inbox that puts the recipient back in control</a> I predict that, in the years to come, we&rsquo;ll be living in a world where marketers return back to sending more meaningful one-to-one emails.</p>
<p>Think about it: <i>How many marketing emails do you receive each day?</i></p>
<p>Keep thinking: <i>How many do you actually open and read?</i></p>
<p>Now picture this, <b>a personalized email from an actual human.</b></p>
<p>Whoa&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;</p>
<p>Like I mentioned before, ToutApp is a great way to to send individual emails to your customers. You might also start by paring down the automated emails you&rsquo;re already sending to use less HTML and automate a series of personalized touch-points.</p>
<p><b>Here&rsquo;s why I think one-to-one emails increase customer retention:</b></p>
<ul><li>Customers want to feel like they are a person, not a number inside your email list.</li>
<li>Customers have their &acirc;&#128;&#156;email guard&acirc;&#128;&#157; up all the time. Use personalized email to break through that guard.</li>
<li>Customers have filters in place now that forward all marketing automation / bulk emails to specific folders &ndash; don&rsquo;t get stuck in a folder that never gets opened.</li>
</ul><p>For more information on this approach, check out <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2237919/email-autofiltering-whats-a-marketer-to-do">Email Auto-Filtering &ndash; What&rsquo;s a Marketer to Do?</a></p>
<h2>7. Use email to send customers gifts and messages on special occasions</h2>
<p>This is probably the oldest trick in the book when it comes to customer retention: remember customer-centric special occasions. Email is the easiest and most effective way to send messages on special occasions like birthdays.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small gesture, but it shows that you care; it shows that you are thinking of them. Remember to make it <b>personalized</b>. People know these sorts of emails are automated but this doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t work, nor does it mean you can&rsquo;t think outside the box. If you can include a free gift in the email, that&rsquo;s even better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redbox.com/">Redbox</a> runs a great birthday email campaign. They send a simple email with an offer for a free one-day DVD rental. Check it out below and <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/birthday-email-deals-steals-encouraging-recipients-to-shop">see more birthday email examples here</a>.</p>

<h2>8. Educate and add value to customers using email</h2>
<p>Email can be used to help educate your customers on your product or service. An educated customer is a generally a well-retained customer as they truly understand the value of your offering.</p>
<p><i>If you didn&rsquo;t know how to work an oven, you&rsquo;d probably throw it out &ndash; right?</i></p>
<p>The same goes for your product or service.</p>
<p>Email is the easiest way you can educate your customers. A great example of this is WP Engine&rsquo;s e-course. As Kareem discusses <a href="http://blog.reemer.com/how-patrick-mackenzie-made-me-thousands-of-dollars">in his blog post</a>, WP Engine sends out eight education emails over a one-month period. Each email focuses on describing a benefit of hosting with WP Engine, then goes on to explain why it&rsquo;s important to your business, and finishes with a call to action.</p>
<p>That is exactly how to use email in a way to educate customers on your product. For another idea, you should also educate your customers on specific issues within their industry.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at an example.</p>
<p>At Client Heartbeat, we do a lot of consulting with our customers on how they can implement customer retention programs to help stop unhappy customers from leaving. We&rsquo;ve done recently is combine all this information into a really intuitive PDF guide. So, all this super-useful information and case studies I&rsquo;ve been working on is now in a tangible, sharable piece of content. Next week I have an email scheduled to send this PDF out to all our customers.</p>
<p>So now, instead of just a couple of customers benefiting from my knowledge on customer retention programs, all our customers have this actionable advice. Now they can walk away with a step-by-step guide on how they can personally stop customers from leaving. This goes a long way toward increasing customer retention. In fact, this sort of stuff builds customer loyalty.</p>
<p>The goal here is to become an information-source so valuable that your customer <b>depends on you</b> for the latest industry trends or actionable how-to guides. They will no longer see you as another product or service they have to pay for but something that their business depends on for success!</p>
<h2>Email is the most effective channel to increase customer retention</h2>
<p>Over the past decade email has commonly been used by marketers to drive customer acquisition and new sales but, as times change and customers get more resistant to push marketing, you need to make sure you allocate time and resources to ensuring you retain your customers. Email is an important part of this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bottom-Line-Customer-Retention-ebook/dp/B00AMQ6HG8/">Annie Miner</a> has showed that customer retention programs can produce ROI of 10:1 &ndash; <i>this is a statistic you </i><b><i>cannot ignore</i></b>.</p>
<p>Email provides the most effective marketing channel when it comes to increasing customer retention. Use these tips in your customer retention strategies, and you will see an increase in customer happiness &ndash; which will lead to more retained customers.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Most businesses send the same sorts of emails: some reach out right after you sign up, only to forget about you days later. Others will send you the occasional update when they are are launching a new product and the rest might send you a few tidbits month-to-month.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar to you? There&rsquo;s no doubt you&rsquo;ve seen these sorts of campaigns time-and-again.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for ways to increase your clicks and conversions then you have to <strong>stand out</strong>: you need to think outside the box and make the most of every opportunity. Success is in the details.</p>
<p>Segmentation gives you the power to send more dynamic, targeted emails. Quality segmentation strategies help you maximise engagement as your customers receive emails that are <strong>more relevant</strong>. Greater relevance leads to higher interaction rates.</p>
<p>The fact is, most email marketers are <em>well</em> aware of of the impact segmentation can have on their bottom line: according to the <a href="http://www.meclabs.com/training/publications/benchmark-report/2012-email-marketing/overview">MarketingSherpa&rsquo;s 2012 Email Marketing Benchmark Report</a>, 52% of marketers say they <em>know</em> they need to improve email database segmentation.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re a marketer looking for inspiration, here are <strong>three ways you</strong> can <strong>segment your customers and email campaigns</strong> for greater clicks and conversions.</p>
<p><span id="more-919"></span></p>
<h2>1. Use well-known dates as triggers</h2>
<p>It might seem obvious but popular calendar dates are a great trigger for email campaigns. Creating copy and creatives can be challenging but, due to the ubiquity of events like Christmas, Father&rsquo;s Day or Mother&rsquo;s Day, these emails are nearly <em>always</em> relevant. Take this campaign from Kiva:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Kiva Mother's Day Example" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kiva-640.png"></p>
<p>Kiva harnesses Mother&rsquo;s Day to introduce customers to a Kiva product (the gift card) that they may never have heard of. In essence this campaign is a &lsquo;cross-sell&rsquo; that uses Mother&rsquo;s Day as the basis for the campaign. Another example of a good campaign driven by a particular date is this campaign from Hipmunk:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Hipmunk Summer Marketing campaign" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hipmunk-640.png"></p>
<p>This is a great example that uses <strong>summer</strong> as the key event and it serves as a reminder that you should harness every opportunity you can to send your customers something relevant. In this instnace the email is quality because it&rsquo;s useful: <strong>people tend to go on holidays in summer</strong> and finding a great deal is often at the top of customers&rsquo; minds.</p>
<p>When using public dates and holidays make sure you put together an editorial calendar and segment on key customer attributes. &lsquo;Location&rsquo; is an obvious one. Dates such as Father&rsquo;s Day are not the same in every country and summer obviously happens at different times, so bear this in mind. Using public dates is an easy way to get started with segmenting your campaigns and can give your email editorial calendar a great base. It&rsquo;s a lightweight way to begin building up a series of lifecycle emails that aim to increase the lifetime value of your customers and keep them coming back. After all, never forget that it costs more to acquire a new customer than it does to maintain a current one.</p>
<p>You can go one than these general dates further and use individual customers&rsquo; birthdays or other customer-centric dates that you collect from sign-up forms or customer profiles. This might sound corny but it is a good way to ease into truly one-to-one email marketing. If you&rsquo;re not into it, don&rsquo;t do birthday emails and instead be creative. For example, a jewellery store might track customers that select &lsquo;This purchase is a gift&rsquo; and ask them if it was for an anniversary. Recording the date would allow this retailer to email individual customers with &lsquo;gift reminders&rsquo; in the future. This sort of campaign starts to become <strong>helpful</strong> for customers and that is when the magic happens.</p>
<p>Think outside the box!</p>
<h2>2. Track your customers&rsquo; online behaviour and actually use it</h2>
<p>Keeping track of past purchases, what features a customer <strong>has</strong> or <strong>has not</strong> used, keeping track of their initial landing page and understanding the products a customer views are all basic examples of behavior you can track to provide more targeted emails.</p>
<p>When a cart is abandoned or multiple visits are made to a particular page you can use this information to send emails to customers at an individual level and ensure each email is <strong>truly</strong> relevant. This is really segmentation in it&rsquo;s purest form as your &lsquo;segments&rsquo; no longer contain tens, hundreds or thousands of users but <strong>one</strong>!</p>
<p>Many businesses spend a lot of time using customer behaviour to influence on-site UI changes or the content that a customer sees but don&rsquo;t forget that you can use it to tailor your email marketing campaigns as well.</p>
<p>The best examples come from the likes of Amazon, who do this tremendously well:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Amazon Segmentation Example" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/campaigns-we-like-amazon.jpg"></p>
<p>Amazon use behaviour to influence both the on-site and off-site experiences and collect information about every user in really subtle ways. They are consistently pushing this customisation further as their product offerings grow &ndash; they can do this cross-device, particularly with their Kindles, iPhone apps and strong focus on mobile.</p>
<p>Another example of their great campaigns is this one:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Amazon awesomely detailed email segmentation" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/amazon-email-2.png"></p>
<p><em>This one was originally mentioned on <a href="http://www.dbswebsite.com/blog/2011/11/17/email-marketing-best-practices/">DBS</a>.</em></p>
<p>Both campaigns are tremendous examples of the power of tracking which products yours customers&rsquo; view and purchase and how to put this data to work in order to personalise each and every email.</p>
<p>Another example from a different category all together is this great email from Travelocity (originally mentioned on <a href="http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2096656/lifecycle-email-marketing-lessons-travelocity-gamersfirst">Clickz</a>):</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Travelocity Email Marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/travelocity.png"></p>
<p>One of the world&rsquo;s largest travel search sites, this campaign targets customers that have recently searched for flights to a location and for whom there is now a discount offer. Tracking individual customer actions allows Travelocity to increase conversion rates thanks to tightly-targeted deals. Savvy.</p>
<h2>3. Use social interests and interactions</h2>
<p>Perhaps the holy grail, emailing customers based on their interactions with other users is extremely effective. At the top end of town companies like Facebook and Twitter have the ability to use their direct social data to drive these sorts of campaigns. Here&rsquo;s an example from Twitter that you are probably familiar with:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Twitter social email marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/twitter-automated-email-640.png"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a similar example from social-shopping site Svpply:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="Svpply social email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/svpply-640.png"></p>
<p>Thanks to the fact that &lsquo;social&rsquo; is now ubiquitous and platforms are opening up, external companies (i.e. non-social networks) are beginning to use the same social data to drive engagement, retention and acquisition campaigns. Gaming and other apps built on top of the Facebook platform are common users of social data when it comes to email but even typical, offline, businesses can make the most of social networks to capture new customers and email subscribers. This savvy campaign by <a href="http://www.uk.rapp.com/">RAPP UK</a> for the Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.uk.rapp.com/blog/2012/04/18/cruk-harnessing-social-to-boost-income-for-race-for-life/">Run for Life</a> uses Facebook and Twitter to create a &lsquo;viral loop&rsquo;:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="RAPP Viral Email" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cruk_email.jpg"></p>
<p>&acirc;&#128;&brvbar;customers that shared via FB and Twitter saw this posted to their wall:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img alt="RAPP Viral Loop Email Marketing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cruk_results.png"></p>
<p>These campaigns are awesome but the simplest way to start is by observing which products are popular on your Facebook, Pinterest or Twitter profiles. Who is sharing your products, services or business with their friends and on which platform? At the very least you can use this information to personalize your newsletters by picking products that you already know are popular.</p>
<p>Going one-step further you can also observe <strong>which</strong> groups of customers are sharing which products and break your newsletters up. You can also flavour your emails based on the particular platform. For example you could track customers that click &lsquo;Pin&rsquo; on a particular product in your store (using Javascript) and include them in a &acirc;&#128;&#156;Pin It to Win It&acirc;&#128;&#157; contest, as you know they have a Pinterest profile.</p>
<p>Likewise you can track customers that like your page on facebook (via your website or perhaps clicking a link in one of your email marketing campaigns) and follow up with a link to a Facebook offer or a discount if they share a product or paritcular piece of content on Facebook.</p>
<h2>Start segmenting!</h2>
<p>Segmenting an email database is all about by providing your customers with targeted, relevant and valuable information that will lead them through the conversion funnel.</p>
<p>If a customer hasn&rsquo;t bought anything in some time, has a birthday just around the bend, or shows a great deal of interest in a product but can&rsquo;t commit, segment your list and react accordingly.</p>
<p>Emails that are targeted and relevant to your audience will lead to an increase in clicks and sales.</p>
<p>What segmentation strategies have you already got in place? What strategies have you seen that you thought were super effective?</p></body></html>

<html><body><p><em>This is a guest post by Tzvi Balbin. Read more about Tzvi after the post!</em></p>
<p>Big data is changing the way we sell our products online. Once only at the fingertips of companies like Amazon, a new era is upon us. It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the buzz words but, back in reality, how can you actually put the concepts behind big data to work in your campaigns?</p>
<p>Despite the fact that, for most of us, true big data analytics is still a long way off, sending powerful <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-2-0/">personalized email campaigns</a> is certainly possible. In fact, it&rsquo;s been possible from day one! It&rsquo;s been right under your nose: you just need to think outside the box. This following campaign is one that I recently used to create a true viral effect and drive revenue from <strong>outside our list</strong>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down step-by-step. <span id="more-713"></span></p>
<h2>1. How to send targeted emails like a big data pro</h2>
<p class=" small-image small-image small-image" style="pxpxpx">Initially working with a client to improve their deliverability, I was doing some research into the ISPs that were represented in their marketing list. I asked the simple question <em>&acirc;&#128;&#156;What ISP&rsquo;s are our subscribers using?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</em> To do this I used a simple formula in Excel. By removing everything before the &acirc;&#128;&#156;@&acirc;&#128;&#157; symbol I got a list of every domain represented in my client&rsquo;s subscriber list. Here&rsquo;s the formula: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/john-smith-1.png" alt="Advanced email marketing personalization"> Here&rsquo;s the result: a list of email addresses in one column and their associated domain in the other. My results looked a bit like this: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/john-smith-2.png" alt="Advanced email personalization"> Using an advanced filter, I then did a count on each of the <strong>unique domains</strong> in the list before exporting the result and graphing it on two axes: X representing the domain name and Y showing the count for that domain. The result was similar to this graph: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/long-tail.png" alt="Email marketing long tail"> This is when things start to get interesting. You will notice that this graph looks similar to a long-tail search report: the majority of customers fell into obvious domains like @gmail.com or @live.com but a <strong>huge</strong> portion fell into other, more specific domains.</p>
<p>This got me wondering: <em>how can I take over the world using that long tail?</em> <em>That needs a little bit of investigating Watson!</em> At scale, the breakdown for most lists will be divided into four sections:</p>
<ol><li>Major ISPs: Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo</li>
<li>Smaller ISPs: Bigpond, iinet (these are Australian mid size ISPs)</li>
<li>Big corporations with large head count: CommBank, JPMorgan, MinterEllison, Allianz Insurance, Walmart, etc.</li>
<li>Small businesses: Bob&rsquo;s Plumbing, Tim&rsquo;s Accounting, those sort of businesses.</li>
</ol><p>Buckets three and four are the true long tail here. This is where I discovered a golden opportunity for some unorthodox, personalized email marketing. What if I used the <strong>domain name that they subscribed with to personalize an email?</strong> &iuml;&iquest;&frac14;</p>
<h2>2. The nuts and bolts: what we did</h2>
<p>Using each of the domains in the list, we added a new column to our email marketing database called &ldquo;company&rdquo;. For example, if I worked at Qantas my email might be user@qantas.com and my &ldquo;company&rdquo; value would have the entry <em>Qantas</em>. If I worked at Coca Cola and my email was user@coke.com my company column would read <em>Coke</em> and so on.</p>
<p>We decided we were going to send out a &lsquo;special offer&rsquo; for each of these companies so we created a coupon code <strong>for every single company mentioned in the &lsquo;company&rsquo; column</strong>. My thought process was that customers at individual businesses and corporations would respond positively to a personalized coupon code: a code that looked like it was <strong>just for them</strong>. At work people sit in close proximity. The idea was to exploit this phenomenon and get people to share and talk about the discount they had just received because they worked at <em>Qantas</em>. I wanted to test the theory that they&rsquo;d <strong>share this email within their place of work</strong>.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px">The email we created used the dynamic coupon codes twice in the email: once in the subject line and once in the actual email. It was a bit like this: <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mockup.png" alt="Dynamic email marketing personalization"> Awesome &hellip; and kind of spooky!</p>
<p>Picture this: <em>Rachel receives our email and leans over her cubicle to Matt.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: &ldquo;Did you get that discount from [insert your brand name]?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: &ldquo;Nope, what&rsquo;s the discount?&rdquo; <em>Jimmy overhears</em></p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a discount on [insert products here]. The code is [insert dynamic coupon], just head to domain.com to grab the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let the viral spread begin! In general, and especially at work, people feel validated when they share good information: it puts them in a position of &acirc;&#128;&#156;power&acirc;&#128;&#157; or &acirc;&#128;&#156;aloofness&acirc;&#128;&#157;. As such Rachel and Jimmy should be happy to share the personalized deal because it is a way of saying &ldquo;without me you wouldn&rsquo;t have received this discount&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just human nature.</p>
<h2>3. Show me the money: measuring the viral effects</h2>
<p>Next morning I logged into Google Analytics to see how the campaign went. It went <strong>really</strong> well. Christmas-came-early well! Here are some results:</p>
<ul><li>Open Rates: increased by 32% over our regular statistics</li>
<li>Click-through rates: increased by 55% over our regular statistics</li>
<li>Average Order Value: increased by 13% over our regular statistics</li>
<li>Conversion rates: up by 86%!</li>
</ul><p>Google Analytics specifically measured the clicks and the associated revenues the email had generated &hellip; but I went a little further and ran a query on our database to display all of transactions that had used one of the coupon codes from the email campaign. I discovered that the total revenue figures were approximately <strong>35% higher than what Google Analytics was reporting</strong>. Why? Then it hit me: database revenue <em>minus</em> Google Analytics revenue was essentially equal to the <strong>viral effect</strong> of our campaign &ndash; in cold hard cash.</p>
<p>The difference represented those who hadn&rsquo;t received the email but whose colleagues told them about the discount. In most instances Google Analytics recorded these customers as direct visits and attributed the revenue to that channel, whilst the people who actually received the email and <strong>clicked it</strong> had the revenue attributed to that correct email campaign tag.</p>
<p>An extra 35% revenue thanks to customers sharing your campaign? Yes please!</p>
<p>On the back of this success we started sending this campaign monthly. Even better, there might even have been a flow-on effect? Assume for a moment that the many of the customers who ordered on that day got their products delivered to their workplace. After their orders are dispatched not only do they arrive on the same day but all at the <strong>same time</strong>. Imagine you&rsquo;re at work and 10 people get parcels, but you don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re bound to ask &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; And inevitably one of your colleagues will tell you &ldquo;there are monthly discounts from [insert your company name] just for us. Subscribe with your work email and they will send you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Seriously viral</strong></p>
<p>The only downside is company email addresses have a higher attrition rate than personal emails. It probably moves with the economy. If the economy is booming you&rsquo;ll have lots of new company subscribers, if it&rsquo;s in a slump many people may loose their job and so too their email addresses. Either way working for a company is generally not &ldquo;forever&rdquo; so you always likely to loose these subscribers anyway.</p>
