<html><body><p>An introduction to analyzing your <em>email</em> data using SQL and a Redshift datastore.</p>
<p>Using data sent to a Redshift database from <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Vero</a>, we&rsquo;ll put together a chart that will help you start to conceptualize how you could build out a detailed and accurate <em>Email Dashboard</em> for your organization.</p>
<p>This will also further the skills you need to analyze your email marketing data when joining it up with the rest of your customer data, using your own data warehouse and SQL charting tools.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we talked about how you could <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/graphing-net-churn-using-redshift-sql/">graph your Net Churn</a> using SQL. This was to introduce you to the world of data warehousing and detailed analysis using your own data.</p>
<p>The post generated <strong>huge interest </strong>so this week we&rsquo;re focusing on email, an area in which we aim to set the benchmark for what&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<h2 class="mti_font_element">Charting open rates for your latest newsletter campaigns</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the chart we&rsquo;ll be building.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7471" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/charting-newsletter-opens/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?fit=955%2C636&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="955,636" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email-marketing-analytics-open-rates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?fit=955%2C636&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7471" src="https://i0.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?resize=955%2C636" alt="email-marketing-analytics-open-rates" width="955" height="636" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?w=955&amp;ssl=1 955w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/email-marketing-analytics-open-rates.png?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2 class="mti_font_element">What you&rsquo;ll need to do this yourself</h2>
<p class="mti_font_element">Here&rsquo;s the setup we use to get accurate and complete data and to chart it beautifully:</p>
<ul class="mti_font_element"><li class="mti_font_element">We use <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Vero</a> to send all of Vero&rsquo;s emails. Vero&rsquo;s campaign management platform helps us create and manage our customer journey so we know who we&rsquo;re sending what, and when. We send both automated and newsletter email campaigns with Vero.</li>
<li class="mti_font_element"><a href="http://www.segment.com">Segment&rsquo;s</a> integration automatically plugs into Vero and allows Vero to send back data on all email deliveries, opens, clicks, unsubscribes and so on into their platform.</li>
<li class="mti_font_element"><a class="mti_font_element" href="http://rjmetrics.com/product/pipeline/">RJ Metrics&rsquo; Pipeline</a> product syncs all of our Segment behavioral data to a Redshift database.</li>
<li class="mti_font_element">Our data warehouse is hosted on a basic <a class="mti_font_element" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html">Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift</a> cluster.</li>
<li class="mti_font_element">We chart our reports using <a class="mti_font_element" href="http://periscopedata.com/">Periscope Data</a>.</li>
<li class="mti_font_element">We also use our own database with data about our users (in this case, we won&rsquo;t be using this data, but we will in the future). Our application uses a mixture of datastores, but a PostgreSQL database contains the most relevant data.</li>
</ul><p>This might sound complex, but all of these steps are a one to five-click process to get running. Once running, you have a really robust pipeline of user interaction data that you can use to build out sophisticated analyses any time you want.</p>
<h2>Building your &lsquo;deliveries&rsquo; and &lsquo;opens&rsquo; data models</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re getting started with your SQL email analysis, the hardest part is getting your data in order.</p>
<p>The first step to creating the chart above is to create two <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_view.asp" target="_blank">SQL Views</a>, one for your deliveries, and one for your opens. These views will represent a nice, clean view of all opens and all deliveries in your datastore, transformed and filtered to remove any junk. We&rsquo;ll then use these tables to build out our charts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive into <strong>deliveries</strong> first.</p>
<p>Using the setup described above, your email data sends up in a Redshift database table via Segment. This is part of a large table called <code>track</code>, representing every user action that you have tracked via Segment (note: this includes any on-site activity, not just email deliveries).</p>
<p>For this analysis, create an SQL view called <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_base</code>. As you can see, this will view returning all of the raw fields you need for your analysis.</p>
<pre><code>create or replace view vero_analysis_deliveries_base as (

  select 
    veroproduction.track.event                        as event,
    veroproduction.track.user_id                      as user_id,
    veroproduction.track.context__traits__email       as context__traits_email,
    veroproduction.track.properties__campaign_name    as properties__campaign_name,
    veroproduction.track.properties__email_subject    as properties__email_subject,
    veroproduction.track.properties__email_type       as properties__email_type,
    veroproduction.track.timestamp                    as timestamp
  from 
    veroproduction.track
    
);</code></pre>
<p>This view can now be queried anytime and has <strong>only</strong> the data you need to create your email analysis charts.</p>
<p>The next step is to create an SQL view called <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered</code>. In this view, select everything from the previous view, and filter out anything you don&rsquo;t need. In this case we don&rsquo;t want to filter anything, but it&rsquo;s worth highlighting this step to help you learn to structure your data better.</p>
<pre><code>create or replace view vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered as (

  select 
    *
  from 
    vero_analysis_deliveries_base
  where
    vero_analysis_sent_base.event = 'Email Delivered'
  and
    vero_analysis_deliveries_base.timestamp is not null

);</code></pre>
<p>At this point, these views include all the data we need to create our tables, so it&rsquo;s time to transform and normalize the formats for various columns (such as date columsn).</p>
<p>In this case we only want to see <code>Email Delivered</code> events (not the other Segment events) so you&rsquo;ll want to filter out any other data in the <code>track</code> table.</p>
<p>To do this, create a view called <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed</code>. This table will select everything from the <code>vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered</code> table and transform various columns, like the <code>received_at</code> column, into a consistent format.</p>
<pre><code>create or replace view vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed as (

  select 
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.user_id                      as user_id,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.context__traits_email        as user_email,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.properties__campaign_name    as campaign_name,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.properties__email_subject    as campaign_subject,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.properties__email_type       as campaign_type,
    vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered.timestamp::timestamp         as date
  from 
    [vero_analysis_deliveries_filtered]
  order by 
    date desc
    
);</code></pre>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! This is the final view you need to do the analysis. At this point the data is accurate, clean and it has it&rsquo;s columns formatted in a way that makes it easy to query any time.</p>
<p>Full credit to the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/jthandy">Tristan Handy</a> at <a href="https://rjmetrics.com/products/pipeline">RJMetrics</a> for this approach.</p>
<h2>Creating your chart</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got everything you need, you can begin charting.</p>
<p>To create the chart mentioned in this post you need to query a table that has three columns: <code>campaign_name</code>, <code>deliveries</code> (the number of emails that were delivered), <code>opens</code> (the number of emails that were opened) and <code>open_rate</code> (the percentage open rate).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the SQL to do this.</p>
<pre><code>with latest_newsletters as (
  select 
    campaign_name,
    max(date) as date
  from  
    [vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed]
  where
    campaign_type = 'newsletter'
  and
    campaign_name not like '%CLONE%'
  group by
    campaign_name
  order by
    max(date) desc
  limit 10
),

opens as (
  select 
    campaign_name,
    count(user_email) as opens
  from
    [vero_analysis_opens_transformed]
  group by
     campaign_name
),

deliveries as (
  select 
    campaign_name,
    count(user_email) as deliveries
  from
    [vero_analysis_deliveries_transformed]
  group by
     campaign_name
)
  
select 
  opens.campaign_name,
  deliveries.deliveries,
  opens.opens,
  (opens.opens::decimal  / deliveries.deliveries::decimal) as open_rate
from
  opens
join
  deliveries
on
  opens.campaign_name = deliveries.campaign_name
where
  opens.campaign_name in (
    select 
      campaign_name
    from
      latest_newsletters
  )</code></pre>
<p>What is presented here comprises of three key steps.</p>
<p>Firstly, this SQL creates a temporary table that returns only the top ten most recent <strong>newsletters</strong> that you&rsquo;ve sent. It does this by looking at the deliveries table and, for each campaign (grouped by the campaign name), returns the time of the last (<code>max</code>) email that was delivered.</p>
<p>You can then order by this field and return just ten campaigns. It&rsquo;s also important, for this example, to filter down just the newsletters and not other automated campaigns (since you&rsquo;ll have data on all of your emails from Vero).</p>
<p>Secondly, this SQL creates temporary tables that count how many deliveries and opens there were per <code>campaign_name</code>. Each of these temporary tables is separate. They return just the <code>campaign_name</code> and the count for the type of interaction we&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Finally, we combine the campaign_name and opens temporary tables to return the <code>campaign_name</code>, the count of emails delivered and the count of emails opened. As part of this step we can do some maths to return a decimal number representing the percentage of emails that were opened.</p>
<p><strong>That&rsquo;s it!</strong> The final output is a table that you can use to create the graph above.</p>
<p>I charted my example using a bar chart to help compare absolute opens with absolute deliveries. I then used a line chart to highlight large peaks in open rate on a second Y axis. This gives a clearer perspective of each metric.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>This post was just an appetizer. This is a very basic analysis of your email data and forms the basis for much more complex, useful and interesting analysis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>If you&rsquo;re a Mandrill customer, last week you <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/important-changes-to-mandrill/">will have read</a> that Mailchimp is unifying <em>Mandrill</em> with its <em>Mailchimp</em> product suite.</p>
<p>We have immense respect for the Mandrill platform, particularly as it is used by many of Vero&rsquo;s customers. With the upcoming changes, we understand that some of Mandrill&rsquo;s transactional customers will have questions around what Mailchimp&rsquo;s new changes mean for them and many of you have asked us whether Vero is a replacement for Mandrill.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put together this post to answer your questions head on. Here we explain the benefits of moving your email campaigns to Vero so you can make an informed decision on what is right for you.</p>
<h2>We&rsquo;ve got you covered</h2>
<p>Here are the four key reasons you&rsquo;ll be in good hands if you migrate from Mandrill to Vero.</p>
<p><strong>Migration help</strong>. Our team of awesome engineers is here to help you with the ins and outs of migrating from Mandrill to Vero, no matter how specific your questions. Our detailed <a href="http://developers.getvero.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal</a> and <a href="http://help.getvero.com/articles/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Getting Started Guide</a> will also help you get started immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing customer support</strong>. With team members around the world, our support is second-to-none. Customers regularly say kind things like <em>&ldquo;Your support is amazing&rdquo;</em>. We&rsquo;re proud to work hard every day to help our customers send emails reliably and improve their customers&rsquo; experiences with every send.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional, Behavioral and Newsletters in one place</strong>. Vero&rsquo;s UI gives you the tools to collect your customer data in real time (our REST API), segment that data and send <strong>all</strong> of your emails from a single UI. Alongside sending transactional emails, you can empower your newsletters and build workflow automations to achieve even more.</p>
<p><strong>Template and user management</strong>. Vero&rsquo;s UI tracks every email your customers have received and lets you feed this back into your segmentation, as well as view each customer&rsquo;s sending history individually. You can also upload and share templates so that your Marketing and Engineering teams work better together.</p>
<h2>Common migration questions</h2>
<h3><strong>How is Vero different from Mandrill and Mailchimp?</strong></h3>
<p>Mandrill is a transactional email service that lets you send raw HTML to an SMTP or API endpoint and sends these emails to customers on your behalf.</p>
<p>Mailchimp is a bulk marketing campaign management platform. It stores your subscribers and lists and lets you send them periodic email campaigns.</p>
<p>Vero takes a new approach. Vero stores your customers and subscribers in a central database, let&rsquo;s you track their activity online, via your backend or in your mobile application and let&rsquo;s you create both bulk marketing and automated campaigns in a single UI. Instead of sending HTML to an endpoint, you create your HTML template in Vero&rsquo;s UI and trigger it via our API.</p>
<p>We believe this approach helps you actually create great customer experiences across all of your messages, including transactional and bulk marketing emails. Here&rsquo;s why we believe this.</p>
<p>In the past, managing your email marketing was simple: you&rsquo;d have a list of customers, collect some basic information about each of those customers and send them emails (that <em>maybe</em> had some basic segmentation).</p>
<p>In 2016, modern APIs allow you to track and learn more about your customers than ever before. The concept of <em>event streams</em> has enabled platforms like <a href="https://segment.com" target="_blank">Segment</a> to give businesses a way of capturing millions, or even billions, of data points about their customers.</p>
<p>At Vero, we recognized this trend back in 2012 and built Vero to help online businesses use the millions of real time events they were capturing to trigger email campaigns. As such, Vero is powered by an API that &ldquo;plays nice&rdquo; in the modern world of online behavioral data tracking.</p>
<p>Behind this API, Vero is built from the ground up around the concept of <em>one record per customer</em>. We believe that when your customers belong to a number of separate lists, the data is scattered and this makes crafting great customer experiences hard. Similarly, sending emails from your code base means you&rsquo;re missing context and potentially sending emails that are out of date.</p>
<p>Using our REST API and Javascript library, <a href="/features/data">you can capture</a> and <em>identify</em> the actions your customers take on your website or in your mobile application &ndash; all in real time.</p>
<p>Once you are capturing customer actions and storing them in Vero, you can use our UI to <a href="/features/people/">create advanced segments of users</a> and use those segments to send targeted, automated and personalized emails. Our advanced features like our <a href="http://help.getvero.com/articles/what-are-external-attributes.html">External Attributes</a> tool are proof of the power of <em>one record per customer</em>, enabling you to pull through hyper-personalised information from your own APIs at <em>send time</em>, based on an individual customer&rsquo;s attributes.</p>
<p>If Vero sounds like a platform that will empower your transactional and other campaigns, <a href="https://app.getvero.com/signup">signup for a free trial</a> and take it for a test drive with our free trial.</p>
<h3><strong>How does Vero handle sending my emails?</strong></h3>
<p>Vero enables you to manage all of your templates and email logic in one central platform, outside of your code.</p>
<p>You can send Newsletters (promotional emails), Behavioral (workflow emails) and Transactional (password resets emails, etc.) campaigns through Vero.</p>
<p>One key question customers have when migrating from Mandrill to Vero is how Vero handles your email delivery. You have two options:</p>
<ol><li>Most customers elect to let Vero manage their delivery for them. We use our own tiered system to handle delivering your emails, in partnership with <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/" target="_blank">Mailgun</a>. We can set you up on shared infrastructure or with your own dedicated IP infrastructure, no matter the size.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can connect your own Sendgrid, Mailgun, Dyn or Mailjet accounts for delivery and use Vero as a CRM and campaign management layer. We typically see large customers, or those that want to retain extra control of their sending infrastructure, take this approach. Historically, you could also configure your Mandrill account for sending.</li>
</ol><p>We&rsquo;re happy to bring our knowledge and manage your delivery for you but, if you want fine-grained control, you can bring your own delivery provider. Vero&rsquo;s power is in it&rsquo;s CRM, segmentation and automation tools.</p>
<p>If you want the best of all worlds, you can in fact do both and choose which delivery option you want on a campaign-by-campaign basis.</p>
<p>If you have detailed questions, get in touch with our Support Team via support@getvero.com.</p>
<h2>Happy emailing</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, we want to help businesses send better messages to their customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re proud to be building a product that helps online businesses email hundreds of millions of customers every month and we&rsquo;re working hard to ensure we innovate every day to help you craft better experiences for your customers.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d love you to check out Vero if you think our approach resonates with you. <a href="mailto:support@getvero.com">Get in touch</a> or <a href="https://app.getvero.com/signup">start a free trial</a>.</p>

<html><body><p>In 2015 two important trends emerged that everyone working to create great products and customer experiences will be interested in:</p>
<ol><li>It is easier than ever before to synchronise data from your SaaS tools <strong>into</strong> a data warehouse (often Amazon&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html">Redshift</a>).</li>
<li>There are more and more great tools (<a href="http://periscopedata.com">Periscope</a>, <a href="https://rjmetrics.com/product/pipeline/">RJ Metrics</a>, <a href="http://www.looker.com/">Looker</a>) that allow you to query and chart the  data in your  warehouse in a sophisticated way.</li>
</ol><p>We&rsquo;re big proponents for both of these trends at <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Vero</a>. In this article, I&rsquo;m going to introduce you to capturing and analysing data directly from a database using Amazon&rsquo;s Redshift and Periscope Data. In this post we&rsquo;re going to chart some basic SaaS metrics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve included a version of some <strong>actual</strong> SQL we use at Vero, and I&rsquo;ve broken down how it works so you can use it, get inspired by it or build upon it.</p>
<p>You can apply the same approach I use here to chart virtually <strong>anything</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that this is a <em>slightly</em> new direction for our blog. If you want to learn more about SQL then let me know in the comments. I&rsquo;m interested in breaking down how to chart other SaaS metrics, product usage, email interactions and so on. We&rsquo;re passionate about this here at Vero.</p>
<h2>Charting upgrades, downgrades, new revenue and churn</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the chart we&rsquo;ll be building, note that <em>news</em> means <em>new revenue</em> in this chart:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img data-attachment-id="7448" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/graphing-net-churn-using-redshift-sql/churn-and-revenue/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/churn-and-revenue.png?fit=954%2C316&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="954,316" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="churn-and-revenue" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/churn-and-revenue.png?fit=300%2C99&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/churn-and-revenue.png?fit=954%2C316&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7448" src="https://i2.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/churn-revenue-graph-sql.png" alt="churn-and-revenue.png" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h2>What you&rsquo;ll need to do this yourself</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the setup we use to get accurate and complete data and to chart it beautifully:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> handles 90%  of Vero&rsquo;s payments, so that&rsquo;s the originator of the data in this graph.</li>
<li><a href="http://rjmetrics.com/product/pipeline/">RJ Metrics&rsquo; Pipeline</a> product syncs this payment data  from Stripe to our data warehouse.</li>
<li>Our data warehouse is hosted on a basic <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/welcome.html">Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift</a> cluster.</li>
<li>We chart our reports using <a href="http://periscopedata.com">Periscope Data</a>.</li>
<li>We also use our own database with data about our users (in this case, the companies that use Vero). Our application uses a PostgreSQL database for this.</li>
</ul><p>At our size, which is not insignificant, the primary cost here is Periscope. We use Periscope as it adds a caching layer and has some great features. We also graph a lot of other data in Periscope (not just the basic payment metrics) so this nets out well for us. The other products combined probably cost us around $300/month at this time (excluding Stripe fees, of course).</p>
<h2>The SQL</h2>
<p>To start off, I&rsquo;ve included the full SQL script being used, so you can see the end goal. This SQL outputs a query table that has the month in the left column and then a column with a dollar figure for each upgrade, downgrades, gross churn and new revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/chexton/aa6d842018cc08b1fcd1" target="_blank">See the full SQL</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting table can be charted using a tool like Periscope Data and a simple bar chart (as you saw in the example above).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s step through the key parts of this SQL. I&rsquo;m going to focus the patterns being used so that you can pick up a few tips on where to head with your own analyses.</p>
<h2>Listing all payments</h2>
<p>The first part of the query creates a temporary table called <code>all_payments</code> that holds every payment, the  customer ID it belongs to and two columns showing whether the payment was the first or last recorded for that  specific customer ID. This gives a nice clean set of data on which we can query throughout the rest of the SQL.</p>
<p>In this table, it&rsquo;s particularly important that we&rsquo;re extracting the first time a customer paid and the last time a customer paid as these represent the month they onboarded and the month they churned). These two columns provide an easy means of querying this later on.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">with all_payments as (
  select 
    p.customer   as customer,
    p.date       as payment_date,
    p.total      as total,
    row_number() over(partition by p.customer 
      order by p.date desc) as first_row,
    row_number() over(partition by p.customer 
      order by p.date asc) as last_row
  from vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices p
  where p.period_end - p.period_start &lt;= 2678400
)</code></pre>
<h2>Listing new customers, per month</h2>
<p>The following snippet of SQL creates a temporary table which holds the dollar value for new revenue in any given month. It has two columns: the <strong>month</strong> and the <strong>total new revenue</strong> for that month, in dollars.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">news AS (
  select sum(all_payments.total)/100 as total,
    date_trunc('month', 
      (timestamp 'epoch' + all_payments.payment_date * interval '1 Second ')
    ) as month
  from all_payments
  where all_payments.last_row = 1
  group by date_trunc('month', 
    (timestamp 'epoch' + all_payments.payment_date * interval '1 Second ')
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>The SQL above queries the <code>all_payments</code> temporary table we created earlier and sums the <code>all_payments.total</code> column, grouped per month, to get the data we need.</p>
<p>There is one section of the query that is a bit fancy and worth reflecting on. Stripe stores the column <code>all_payments.payment_date</code> as a Unix integer timestamp. In order to output the nice, consistent date format <code>2016-02-01</code> we need to convert them. As we&rsquo;re using Redshift to do our queries, the following SQL example handles this:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">date_trunc('month', 
      (timestamp 'epoch' + all_payments.payment_date * interval '1 Second ')
    )</code></pre>
<h2>Querying upgrades and downgrades between months</h2>
<p>The following SQL makes up the most complex in the entire query in the sense that there is a <strong>lot</strong> going on:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">plan_changes as (
  select 
    vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.customer as customer,
    date_trunc('month', 
      (timestamp 'epoch' + vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.date * interval '1 Second ')
    ) as month,
    case vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions.plan__interval 
      when 'year' 
      then vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.total/100/12 
      else vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.total/100 
      end as now,
    coalesce(
      case all_payments_by_month.plan__interval 
        when 'year' 
        then all_payments_by_month.total/100/12 
        else all_payments_by_month.total/100 
        end,
      0) as before,
    (case vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions.plan__interval 
      when 'year' 
      then vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.total/100/12 
      else vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.total/100 
      end) - (coalesce(
        case all_payments_by_month.plan__interval 
        when 'year' 
        then all_payments_by_month.total/100/12 
        else all_payments_by_month.total/100 
        end,
      0)) as change
  from vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices
  left outer join all_payments_by_month
    on date_trunc('month', add_months((timestamp 'epoch' + vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.date * interval '1 Second '),-1)) = all_payments_by_month.date_of_invoice
    and all_payments_by_month.customer = vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.customer
  join vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions
    on vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions.id = vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.subscription
  where vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.forgiven is not true
    and vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.paid is true
    and coalesce(all_payments_by_month.total/100,0)  0  
    and vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.period_end - vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.period_start </code></pre>
<p>Ultimately, this SQL query outputs a table with five columns: <code>customer</code> (the customer ID from Stripe), <code>month</code> (in the format <code>2016-02-01</code>), <code>now</code> (the amount the customer paid in the given month), <code>before</code> (the amount they paid the month before), <code>change</code> (the difference between <code>now</code> and <code>before</code>).</p>
<p>There are a few complex sections of this snippet, so I'll talk through these one-by-one.</p>
<p>Firstly, we use the SQL <code>case</code> statement. This allows us to return a one of two different results in the <code>now</code>, <code>before</code> and <code>change</code> columns based on the value of the <code>stripe_subscriptions.plan_interval</code> column.</p>
<p>In this example, we're checking whether the Stripe subscription <code>interval</code> is set to <code>year</code> or to <code>month</code>. If it's set to year, we divide the total payment made by 12. This is to ensure we smooth out the numbers -&Acirc;&nbsp;otherwise we'd see huge spikes in MRR in months where customers paid annually:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">case vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions.plan__interval 
      when 'year' 
      then vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.total/100/12 
      else vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.total/100 
      end as now</code></pre>
<p>We use this same methodology for the <code>before</code> and <code>change</code> columns.</p>
<p>In the <code>plan_changes</code> query we also do two joins. One of the joins is used to link the Stripe <code>vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices</code> table we're using with the Stripe <code>vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions</code>. To create this join we tell the query which column links the two tables. In this case it's the <code>stripe_subscriptions.id</code> column, as this <code>id</code> is present in both tables, represented as <code>stripe_subscriptions.id</code> and <code>stripe_invoices.subscription</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">join vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions
    on vero_stripe_production.stripe_subscriptions.id = vero_stripe_production.stripe_invoices.subscription</code></pre>
<p>One final, handy little trick, in the <code>plan_changes</code> query is the use of <code>coalesce</code>. This tells the SQL to return either the first value or, if that's blank, return the second value. I have used this in a few places where we want to return <code>0</code> rather than <code>null</code> to ensure there is a value present that can be used in calculations. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>coalesce(all_payments_by_month.total/100, 0)</code></pre>
<h2>Pulling it all together</h2>
<p>The last part of the SQL creates the final table that will actually be charted. It has columns for <code>month</code>, <code>new</code> (new revenue), <code>churn</code>, <code>downgrades</code> and <code>upgrades</code>.</p>
<p>Before running this SQL we consolidate each key metrics into its own temporary table, one for <code>news</code>, one for <code>downgrades</code> and so on. We've already covered the temporary table <code>news</code> up above. That example outputs a table with each month and the dollar value of new revenue for that month. The same thing applies for the other three temporary tables we create in the overall SQL: <code>churns</code>, <code>downgrades</code> and <code>upgrades</code>.</p>
<p>We can then join and query <strong>all</strong> four tables and create one, clean table for Periscope Data to chart.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs sql">select 
  upgrades.month,
  upgrades.total                as upgrades,
  coalesce(downgrades.total,0)  as downgrades,
  coalesce(churns.total,0)*-1   as churn,
  coalesce(news.total,0)        as news
from upgrades
left outer join downgrades
  on upgrades.month = downgrades.month
left outer join churns
  on upgrades.month = churns.month
left outer join news
  on upgrades.month = news.month
where upgrades.month </code></pre>
<p>You'll note two things that are important about this query:</p>
<ul><li>We use a `left outer join` to ensure that if any of the tables we're querying are missing a value for a certain month that they do not cause the table to break.</li>
<li>We exclude the current month as this will always render incomplete and show wildly exaggerated churn and downgrade figures until the month passes (as not everyone has been charged for the current month as it proceeds).</li>
</ul><p>Both of these help ensure the resulting graph doesn't have any gaps or jagged data, keeping our graph accurate and smooth.</p>
<h2>Why use SQL at all?</h2>
<p>This example is just the tip of the iceberg! The beauty of using SQL for this sort of charting is that not only can you fully customise the resulting charts, but you can query data <strong>across</strong> databases, allowing you to do really sophisticated analyses. For example, we could run this same report but limit it to companies that have interacted with Vero in the last seven days, or to companies that have more than 50 campaigns, or to companies that have been with Vero for a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>If you're interested, please leave a comment or email me at chrish@getvero.com. There is so much that can be done with SQL and I'm excited to share how we use the same data to run queries across multiple databases and also chart our email interactions.</p>
<p>We've found running SQL queries allows us to produce consolidated reports which actually get looked at and actioned. It's forced us to be selective about what we query and this may be one of the most valuable aspects of the whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>this script is slightly different from the one we use in production and has been pared down for this article, so if you see improvements or breaking code (though, it has been tested with our setup), please let me know and we'll update it.</p></body></html>

<p>Making your email subscribers feel special is a great way to generate excitement for the content or offers you send them. It&rsquo;s also a powerful community-building tool.</p>
<p>Exclusivity can be subtle, like the Apple example below, or it can be overt, like <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/" target="_blank">Groove</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever Apple launches a new product, customers camp outside their stores to get their hands on the latest device. By offering a pre-order, Apple can cash in on that excitement without putting additional stress on their retail stores. With free shipping as an added incentive, these emails will no doubt drive huge sales before the next iPhone is even released. (Within three days of the iPhone 6 launch, Apple had sold <strong>10 million</strong> phones.)</p>

<p>Groove&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmturnbull" target="_blank">Alex Turnbull</a> takes a more direct approach. He emails new posts out to blog subscribers before they are available to people who read via RSS feeds or social media.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a subscriber, you&rsquo;re getting this link about an hour before the post goes live on our blog&rsquo;s homepage.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Each email he sends begins with the words &ldquo;Early Access&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It makes email recipients feel like they are part of an exclusive club because, well, they are! Over the course of that hour, Alex can collect feedback and make any changes he feels would improve the post as more people see it. We asked Alex about the strategy. Here&rsquo;s what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The early access emails help us build a better relationship with our readers. It&rsquo;s a value-add on top of just getting the content each week. I&rsquo;ve heard from dozens of folks who appreciate the exclusive look at the new content before we release it, and we even see people urging others to sign up because of that benefit.</p>
<p>We send emails every single Thursday. It gets people used to hearing from us, and our open rates are higher because of that. Even if you&rsquo;re not writing new posts each week, you can still send useful emails to maintain that relationship.</p>

<p>Your email subscribers are getting dozens, if not hundreds, of other emails every day. They are constantly being asked to start a free trial, download an e-book or follow someone on Twitter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an <a href="/resources/quality-over-quantity" target="_blank">overwhelming amount of noise in the inbox</a>. Showing your users that you care goes a long way towards earning their trust. Squarespace, for example, takes a friendly approach to urgency. False emergencies &ndash; &ldquo;LAST DAY TO SAVE!!!&rdquo; &ndash; comes off as desperate. Squarespace acknowledges the reality of our busy lives and offers a chance for an extended trial.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone gets busy and you may not have had enough time to evaluate Squarespace.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.getvero.com/expert-email-advice/">Buffer&rsquo;s Kevan Lee</a> told us that his best email advice is to &ldquo;Delight your subscribers&rdquo;. Dropbox took that advice to a new level with <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dropbox-email-marketing.jpg" target="_blank">this email</a>. They gave me 10x the storage space for the same price!

<p>Of course, this a major business decision, not just an email marketing tactic. But the decision reflects Dropbox&rsquo;s mission as a company: <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/retention-email-inspiration">to make their customers happy</a>. Email is just an extension of their core beliefs.</p>

<div class="toc title red" id="3."><h2><span class="number"> 3. </span><span class="title">Ask for feedback.</span></h2></div>
<p>As long as you aren&rsquo;t pushy, it&rsquo;s okay to <a href="/resources/customer-feedback" target="_blank">ask for feedback</a>.</p>
<p>I get lots of emails from RunKeeper, but this is the first from Tom Boates, the company&rsquo;s VP of User Experience. This is an interesting way to help users get to know the company they are supporting and it could also help users get a better product in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Doing so would be a great help to myself and the team here in making sure we are providing you with the best experience possible.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you ask for help, be genuine and people will respond.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="537px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7372" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/runkeeper-feedback.jpg" alt="runkeeper-feedback" width="537" height="430"></p>
<p>Feedly takes a similar approach by introducing me to someone new in the company. They aren&rsquo;t begging me to come back, they are simply asking what led to the cancelation. The company has earned a reputation for being trustworthy and innovative, so I was happy to offer candid feedback.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="522px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7373" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/feedly-pro-email.jpg" alt="feedly-pro-email" width="522" height="290"></p>
<p>If you are going to ask for feedback, you need to make it dead simple. Dollar Shave Club, <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/dollar-shave-club/">as we&rsquo;ve written before</a>, is fanatical about&Acirc;&nbsp;user experience. The subscription is easy, the blades are good and the marketing is captivating. Everything about Dollar Shave Club is a pleasure, including their survey emails.</p>
<p>The easier it is to leave feedback, the more people will do it.</p>

<div class="toc title blue-gray" id="4."><h2><span class="number"> 4. </span><span class="title">Use social proof.</span></h2></div>
<p>From the <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/social-proof-factors-2/">KISSmetrics blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li><em>Over 70% of Americans say they look at product reviews before making a purchase.</em></li>
<li><em>Nearly 63% of consumers indicate they are more likely to purchase from a site if it has product ratings and reviews.</em></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>Social proof is the reason sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor continue to thrive. Consumers trust what other consumers think. The same principle can easily be applied to email marketing. It&rsquo;s best used subtly, as you don&rsquo;t want to toot your own horn.</p>
<p>Look how FlightFox casually mentioned that 97% of customers would recommend the latest version of the service. That&rsquo;s a stunning number, and it&rsquo;s included in an email about a new blog post.</p>
<p>If you have a number like that to share, make sure everyone knows about it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7375" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/flightfox-social-proof.jpg" alt="flightfox-social-proof" width="796" height="1136"></p>
<p>Many forums and communities take full advantage of social proof. Because they have active users, they can parlay engagement into more engagement. Quora, who we&rsquo;ll discuss more in this post, does this beautifully. Readers can use the number of votes on a discussion to decide which link to click.</p>

<p>GrowthHackers takes a similar approach but with even more emphasis on their users&rsquo; activity. If a GrowthHackers discussion has 20 comments, you know there is good information being passed around.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a forum, consider including social share numbers in your newsletters. The effect is the same &ndash; readers want to know what their peers are interested in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only strong people are comfortable talking about their failures.&rdquo; &ndash; <em>Hayes Drumwright, CEO of Trace3 (a $300 million company)</em></p>
<p>Email is a good opportunity to humanize your brand. The inbox is an intimate place, mostly used for personal conversation. Your presence there is a privilege, so do your best to <a href="http://paulgraham.com/talk.html" target="_blank">write like a human</a>.

<p>Recently I was chatting with David Sherry, co-founder of <a href="/resources/guides/death-to-the-stock-photo/" target="_blank">Death to the Stock Photo</a>, about his company&rsquo;s email strategy. They&rsquo;ve grown their business almost entirely with email (we&rsquo;ll look at an example later in this post) and he offered some magical advice:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Make conversion a habit.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple, but seriously profound. He builds opportunities for <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/small-wins/">small conversions</a> into every email so that people get used to taking action. This can be as simple as &ldquo;Follow me on Twitter&rdquo; or as significant as &ldquo;Upgrade your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Death to the Stock Photo includes free, downloadable stock photos in each email. People are used to clicking his emails because there is always value in converting.</p>

<p>Buffer is great at this too. In the <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/the-complete-guide-to-transactional-email/">transactional email</a> below, they are aiming for a small conversion: user engagement with their app. By creating pre-made tweets, they make it as easy as possible for the user to convert. The conversion doesn&rsquo;t directly result in revenue, but it does get users in the habit of 1) clicking their emails and 2) using the app.</p>

<p><a href="http://emailinsights.com/" target='_blank"'>EmailInsights</a> builds in even smaller calls to action. In the email below, they are looking for feedback on their product, but also ask the user to connect with the founder, Chuck Blake, on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Again, the conversion doesn&rsquo;t directly create revenue but if the user does it, they will be exposed to more content from Email Insights and they can get a feel Chuck&rsquo;s experience and personality.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>Email is the perfect platform to exchange files.</strong></p>
<p>Marketing emails usually don&rsquo;t contain files because the focus is on messaging, calls to action and design. Why not add some utility to your emails?</p>
<p>As discussed above, Death to the Stock Photo does this beautifully. They only send one email per month, but each contains a downloadable file of stunning images that you can use on your blog or in your email. (Read more about <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/guides/death-to-the-stock-photo/">how Death to the Stock Photo built a profitable business with email</a>.)</p>
<p>Their emails delight users not only because of the stylish design but because of their utility. This email empowers the user to take action and the habit-forming nature makes it easier to ask users to upgrade to their premium level.</p>

<p>The cardinal sin of conversion is failure to make the next step abundantly clear. How can someone convert if they aren&rsquo;t sure what to do?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/scrolling-tips/">Conversion Rate Experts</a> stress this over and over again: &ldquo;Be clear and direct with your users, telling them exactly what you&rsquo;d like them to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look how seriously <a href="http://backlinko.com/" target="_blank">Backlinko</a>&lsquo;s Brian Dean takes this advice. This email was sent immediately after registering for a webinar and he tells me <em>exactly</em> what to do next.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: just add the webinar to your calendar. Not only does this reinforce the behavior pattern of clicking Brian&rsquo;s emails, but it also increases the chances that the registrants actually attend the webinar. Once it&rsquo;s on the calendar, they will get alerts from their phone and/or computer &hellip; it&rsquo;s like free marketing.</p>

<p>Answering the question &ldquo;What should I do next?&rdquo; is also a great way to boost engagement with a SaaS app. Dropbox asks you to sign in since they know their in-app onboarding is so good. They also include a link to their getting started guide.</p>

<p>In KISSmetrics&rsquo; case, a new user <em>has</em> to take the next step or they won&rsquo;t get any value from the tool. Clearly, they&rsquo;ve heard this question before, which is why the present it in bold text and in quotations, as if the reader is asking it out loud. They keep the language very simple, then present a button, with a contrasting color and friendly copy, to move the user onward.</p>

<div class="toc title blue" id="9."><h2><span class="number"> 9. </span><span class="title">Keep readers on their toes.</span></h2></div>
<p>This tip is unconventional, but it&rsquo;s proven to work.</p>
<p>On one hand, you want your readers to know what to expect in your emails. In HelpScout&rsquo;s case, that means a great blog every Wednesday without fail. In ProductHunt&rsquo;s case, that means five new products every day. The user never knows what those products will be, but they have come to expect value from these emails, which is why they are opened at such a high rate.</p>
<p>ProductHunt is a <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/post/43986871442/email-first-startups">email-first startup</a>, meaning that it started as a newsletter and later grew into a website, podcast, and mobile app. While it might sound counterintuitive to keep readers on their toes, the strategy has been proven by ProductHunt as well as other companies, like Timehop and iDoneThis.</p>
<p>First Round Review published a <a href="http://firstround.com/article/Product-Hunt-is-Everywhere-This-is-How-It-Got-There">detailed account of ProductHunt&rsquo;s growth</a> which we highly recommend checking out.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Even though the email was super basic, it gave me validation that people cared about this content,&rdquo; says Hoover. And when he eventually decided to build the site, the email list became the most important asset and springboard for driving traffic and keeping people coming back again and again. It&rsquo;s continued to swell as Product Hunt has gained momentum, a constant source of new fans and marketing opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the examples.</p>
<p><a href="/resources/product-hunt/" target="_blank">ProductHunt goes big on email.</a> Every email they send is loaded with new apps, tools and products that are validated with social proof. You never know what you are going to get, but you always know it&rsquo;s going to be something really good.</p>

<p>This strategy is easier when you have user generated content like Quora and ProductHunt. Quora also employs social proof in their emails to validate the quality of the links they include.</p>

<p>This is another tactic that might be considered unconventional, but it&rsquo;s actually very effective if your users trust you and your brand. It&rsquo;s a good idea to do this with transactional emails, like receipts, to make it very easy for users to find and reference them. But the tactic can be useful for newsletters and marketing emails too if you send them on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.</p>
<p>Remember, you want your recipients to look forward to your emails so much that it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the subject says.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s <em>a lot</em> of emails and it would be a struggle to come up with a new subject line every single day. More importantly, though, Alexis&rsquo; newsletter is highly anticipated by its recipients so the subject line doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s delivery each morning is familiar but still exciting.</p>

<p>Referral codes work because <em>everyone</em> wins: the referrer, the referree, and the business.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://blog.referralcandy.com/2013/11/06/referral-marketing-awesome-infographic/">ReferralCandy</a>, 83% of satisfied customers are willing to refer a product or service but just 29% actually do. If you can motivate them to refer friends and family, it makes conversion a breeze: 92% of consumers trust referral over ads.</p>
<p>Adding referral codes to your emails is one way to turn every email into a sales opportunity.</p>

<p>Not only is it fun get credit towards your next ride, it&rsquo;s a super smart strategy that has <a href="http://blog.uber.com/2011/09/22/chicago-ubers-biggest-launch-to-date/">helped Uber grow fast</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>95% of all our riders have heard about Uber from other Uber riders. Our virality is almost unprecedented. For every 7 rides we do, our users&rsquo; big mouths generate a new rider.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Simply amazing.</strong></p>
<p>Dollar Shave Club puts even more emphasis on referrals in their emails:</p>

<p>Why would anyone <strong>not</strong> do this?</p>
<p>Well, you must have complete confidence in your brand to attempt to turn customers into salespeople. They, in turn, must be confident enough in your product to tell friends and family about it. If your product rocks, including referral codes in your emails is a no-brainer.</p>
<div class="toc title red" id="12."><h2><span class="number"> 12. </span><span class="title">Use buttons.</span></h2></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the simplest email marketing advice you&rsquo;ll ever receive:</p>
<p><strong>If you want people to click, use buttons.</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of case studies on the topic. <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/4275/buttons-email-marketing-campaigns">Campaign Monitor</a>, for example, got a 28% increase on click-thrus when they A/B tested emails with and without buttons.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing copy and designing buttons, we always refer to conversion expert <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2012/11/how-to-find-and-eliminate-friction-words-in-your-web-copy/">Joanna Wiebe</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="snippet"><p><strong>What should my button say?</strong><br>
A great rule of thumb when writing a call to action is to make your button copy complete this sentence: I want to ________________</p>
<p><strong>What should my button look like?</strong></p>
<ul><li>A 3D effect</li>
<li>A contrasting, non-grey color</li>
<li>Feedback on hover (e.g., different color)</li>
<li>Whitespace around it</li>
<li>An arrow pointing to it with instructional copy</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Examples of this in email marketing are abundant, but here are few designs we really liked.</p>
<p>This Evernote email employs soft colors and encouraging language. It tees up the call to action by explaining why Evernote is so powerful before coming on strong with a bold, green button.</p>

<p>In this example from <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/" target="_blank">CreativeLive</a>, there is no mistaking what they want you to do. The call to action is bold, simple and direct.</p>

<p>Good examples of this are too massive to include as screenshots. Click the links below to see them.</p>

</ul><p>Impressive, right?</p>
<p>The first thing we should say about these emails is that <strong>they aren&rsquo;t for everyone</strong>. The second thing we should say is that <strong>they are for someone</strong>.</p>
<p>Think very carefully about your niche before creating and sending an email this massive. Here&rsquo;s why these emails work for their respective audiences:</p>
<ul><li>In <a href="http://petapixel.com/" target="_blank">PetaPixel&rsquo;s</a> case, they are appealing to hardcore photographers, people that eat, sleep and breath gear, software and reviews. The more, the better.</li>
<li><a href="http://tucsontopia.com/" target="_blank">TucsonTopia</a> is strictly a local publication. Their weekly email is super valuable because it contains <strong>tons</strong> of information about timely local events.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/" target="_blank">Brain Pickings</a> is a different kind of beast. Every email is an intellectual adventure. Maria Popova pours her heart and soul into it and has grown a massive audience as a result.</li>
</ul><p>Again, not for everyone it&rsquo;s something to consider if you think your audience would embrace it.</p>

<div class="toc title purple" id="14."><h2><span class="number"> 14. </span><span class="title">Remind readers what you do.</span></h2></div>
<p>When we asked Belle Beth Cooper for her <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/expert-email-advice/">best email advice</a>, here&rsquo;s what she told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t expect people to remember what you do &ndash; it&rsquo;s your job to remind them, every time. Every email we send about Exist, whether it&rsquo;s to existing users or people who signed up for our mailing list months ago, includes a link to remind them what Exist is. <strong>And that link gets clicks every time.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost too simple. When we checked out the emails from her budding startup <a href="https://exist.io/" target="_blank">Exist</a>, we found she does exactly that.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7388" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/collect-the-data/poncho-1/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-1.png?fit=645%2C517&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="645,517" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="poncho 1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-1.png?fit=300%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-1.png?fit=645%2C517&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7388" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/exist-email-practices.jpg" alt="exist email practices" width="807" height="349"></p>
<p>This is the simplest advice in this guide and there is nothing to lose by implementing it immediately. Don&rsquo;t overlook the little things.</p>

<div class="toc title orange" id="15."><h2><span class="number"> 15. </span><span class="title">Leverage your partners' brand power.</span></h2></div>
<p>If your product or service integrates with other products or services, you are sitting on top of a gold mine of brand power. Leveraging the power of <em>other</em> brands is a great way to accelerate the authority of your own.</p>
<p>Buffer creates case studies of some of their biggest customers to appeal to enterprise customers. In the example below, they show how Business Insider grew its Facebook presence.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7389" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/collect-the-data/poncho-9/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-9.png?fit=448%2C237&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="448,237" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="poncho 9" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-9.png?fit=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-9.png?fit=448%2C237&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7389" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/buffer-partner.jpg" alt="buffer-partner" width="795" height="854"></p>
<p>Zapier and IFTTT, services that rely almost entirely on partners to attract users and grow, emphasize other powerful brands in most of their emails.</p>
<p>In Zapier&rsquo;s case, Highrise integration adds valuable utility to any of their users who also use Highrise. It makes both services more valuable.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7390" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/collect-the-data/poncho-2/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-2.png?fit=636%2C234&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="636,234" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="poncho 2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-2.png?fit=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/poncho-2.png?fit=636%2C234&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7390" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/zapier-email-best-practices.jpg" alt="zapier email best practices" width="811" height="846"></p>
<p>IFTTT is growing fast &ndash; they just netted a <a href="http://time.com/3207218/ifttt-internet-of-things/">$30 million investment</a> &ndash; but Nike is far bigger. In fact, <em><a href="http://www.forbes.com/companies/nike/">Forbes</a></em> ranks Nike as the world&rsquo;s 24th most valuable brand. If you can use their brand power to boost your own, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Notice also that IFTTT lets images do the talking for them. The example newsletter below contains <em>just eight words</em>. We asked IFTTT co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/MrTibbets" target="_blank">Alexander Tibbets</a> about the strategy and he explained that each recipe has a story that can be told with imagery.</p>
<blockquote><p>We love to <em>show</em> rather than <em>tell</em>. IFTTT is designed to be a visually engaging experience, so it&rsquo;s only natural to approach our newsletter in the same way.</p></blockquote>

<div class="toc title blue" id="16."><h2><span class="number"> 16. </span><span class="title">Make people happy.</span></h2></div>
<p>Generosity is one of the most overlooked email marketing tactics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard to make people happy. How many assets do you have that you could use to make an email recipient&rsquo;s day a little brighter? If you aren&rsquo;t ready to give something away, simply say something nice, tell an uplifting story or just ask how they are.</p>
<p>This email from Gazelle is a great example of a transactional email with a marketing twist. Gazelle owes me $94, so it&rsquo;s going to be easy to make me happy, but they took the time build excitement into the email. The subject line &ndash; &ldquo;Your happy email is here!&rdquo; &ndash; would catch anyone&rsquo;s attention and the bold treatment of the dollar amount reinforces just how valuable this email is.</p>
<p>Notice, also, that they included a referral link and a one-question survey. This is how transactional emails are done.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7394" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gazelle-email-best-practices.jpg" alt="gazelle email best practices" width="765" height="548"></p>
<p>Starbucks is great at this as well. For every 12 drinks you buy, you get one free and this is the email they send. Again, it&rsquo;s a transactional email chock full of email best practices. Look at all the other tactics it employs:</p>
<ul><li>Includes referral link (#11)</li>
<li>Tells me what to do next (#8)</li>
<li>Delights the recipient (#16)</li>

<div class="toc title purple" id="17."><h2><span class="number"> 17. </span><span class="title">Tap into social trends and current events.</span></h2></div>
<p>Urgency can seem desperate, but timeliness is always powerful.</p>
<p>Tapping into current events or seasonal trends is a good way to encourage readers to open and click emails since their value is passing. Here&rsquo;s another example from Gazelle, who always uses Apple events as a marketing opportunity. Apple creates the buzz for them, and they cash in with strong offers and timely marketing.</p>
<p>The messaging is clear: &ldquo;Help us help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another great example from the health and fitness website Greatist. Each fall, Starbucks offers the Pumpkin Spice Latte. It&rsquo;s extremely popular with customers (even if it&rsquo;s not the healthiest drink) and Starbucks makes a big deal about the limited availability of the drink. Greatist recognized the buzz as a great opportunity to offer healthier alternatives. You can&rsquo;t send this email in March, it only works because of the season and the buzz created by Starbucks.</p>

<div class="toc title green" id="18."><h2><span class="number"> 18. </span><span class="title">Say thanks.</span></h2></div>
<p>Saying thank you is the easiest, simplest way to humanize your emails and evoke emotion in the recipient. <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/11/do-you-really-need-to-say-than/">Harvard Business Review</a> explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; &ndash; sincerely and with heart &ndash; feels good. Not just to the person receiving it, but also to the person offering it. And that&rsquo;s part of work too. It&rsquo;s hard to remember, as we process our hundredth email, that behind each message is a person.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are grateful for your subscribers, users, and customers, let them know. You don&rsquo;t have to dedicate an entire email to it (like the examples below) but you can build gratitude into every email you send.</p>
<p>Simple, a banking service startup, sent me this email after I requested an invite to their platform. This came in place of a <a href="/resources/welcome-emails/" target="_blank">welcome email</a> and it made a great first impression of the company.</p>

<p>Outbrain sent me this message to let me know that their platform had reached 500 million unique users. That&rsquo;s an impressive milestone &ndash; and valuable social proof &ndash; that absolutely warrants an email. This message isn&rsquo;t designed to convert new users or drive revenue, it&rsquo;s simply a positive reflection of the Outbrain brand.</p>

<p>Trello recently reached 5 million users and sent this email to make the announcement. They took it a step further by offering a free month of Trello Gold, their premium level. They also incorporated a referral program to help spread the word on their achievement and their paid plans.</p>

<p>Your users expect <a href="/resources/product-update-emails" target="_blank">product update emails</a>. The problem with most announcement emails is that they are either a) too salesy or b) too boring. Creating an email loaded with utlity <em>and</em> marketing value is no easy task but if you know these types of emails get opened, you need to put in the extra effort.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Wunderlist email below. The update is exciting but look at the language they use in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a registered Wunderlist user we wanted to let you know that we&rsquo;ve just released a major new update, Wunderlist 3.</p></blockquote>
<p>They are reminding the recipient that they are part of an exclusive club. The email builds on the excitement by explaining just how valuable the update is, then brings it home with a strong call to action in a bold button. (Like most of the emails in this guide, they are using several of our best practices.)</p>

<p>KISSmetrics take a more low-key approach. Instead of going for the &ldquo;wow&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s almost like they are saying, &ldquo;A brand new interface for our innovative app? No problem.&rdquo; Once you get to know the folks at KISSmetrics, you understand why cool products like this are an expectation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no accident that <a href="http://postach.io/" target="_blank">Postach.io</a> sends great emails. We reached to their Community Manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/CalebMcIntyre_" target="_blank">Caleb McIntyre</a>, who shared his five rules for crafting effective emails:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Be personal:</strong> Speak on a first-name basis and share news as though you are just a fellow product user, not an employee.</li>
<li><strong>Be relevant:</strong> Send triggered messages based on a user&rsquo;s actual actions.</li>
<li><strong>Be anticipated:</strong> Don&rsquo;t send mass messages unless you know that each receiver can actually use the info you&rsquo;re sending them.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it short:</strong> Focus on quality over quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Converse:</strong> Always offer a warm invite for people to ask questions and send something back to you.</li>

<p>There is a reason that video games cause some people to actually become addicted. Games, and their rewards, reinforce behavior that users want to repeat. Players earn achievements and unlock new levels, only to be sent out on new quests to earn and unlock more. There is <a href="/resources/zeigarnik-effect" target="_blank">some interesting pyschology at play here</a>.</p>
<p>Marketers use gamification to attempt to turn behavior into habit. Nir Eyal, an expert on habits and behavior, has written extensively on behavior design:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone suddenly seems interested in messing with your head. Gamification, Quantified Self, Persuasive Technology, Neuromarketing and a host of other techniques offer ways to influence behavior. At the heart of these techniques is a desire to change peoples&rsquo; habits so that behavior change becomes permanent.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/03/how-to-design-behavior.html">Read way more about that here.</a></p>
<p>Using gamification techniques in email is an interesting way to get users in the habit of opening and engaging with email. We already talked about Starbucks use of stars to encourage custoners to buy more often. In addition to awarding stars for buying a drink in a Starbucks store, they also offer stars for other things. In the example below, they are offering three extra stars for buying a bag of Starbucks coffee at a grocery store.</p>
<p>The more stars, the more free drinks. Starbucks uses stars to get customers to do all kinds of things &ndash; come in after 2 pm, buy a sandwich, try new products, etc.</p>

<p>The reason TripAdvisor is such a great website is because they&rsquo;ve taken social proof to a new level. Reviews are the lifeblood of the site and they use gamification to encourage users to write reviews of places they&rsquo;ve been.</p>

<p>What do badges mean for users? Nothing really, minus recognition for their contribution to the community. People find TripAdvisor so helpful, however, that they write reviews to pay it forward, according to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/avaseave/2013/06/20/how-tripadvisor-grows-scale-and-network-effects-expertise-in-gathering-ugc/"><em>Forbes</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Adam Medros, TripAdvisor&rsquo;s VP of Global Product] says that awarding regular contributors status designations and levels cannot be over-emphasized. &ldquo;It is an incredibly successful and powerful program our marketing team put into place the last few years around recognizing and creating this desire to come back and keep up your status and keep contributing.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that TripAdvisor taps into social proof to help convince people to contribute: &ldquo;If 170 million other people have written reviews, maybe I should too.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><div class="toc title blue" id="21."><h2><span class="number"> 21. </span><span class="title">Use the 1-2-3 method.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>You might know what to say in an email, but aren&rsquo;t sure how to say it. Fear not, the <a href="/resources/1-2-3-method/">1-2-3 method</a> is here to save you. It&rsquo;s a tried-and-true email format that promotes action.</p>
<p>All you need to do is tell the recipient the next three steps. The steps must be crystal clear, as providing an obvious path eliminates the anxiety of the unknown. Now that you&rsquo;re aware of this technique, you&rsquo;ll start noticing it in your inbox all the time.</p>
<p>It works especially well in <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/onboarding-emails/">onboarding campaigns</a> and <a href="/resources/welcome-emails/">welcome emails</a>. Twitter is one of my favorite examples. They match each number to a visual example.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7457" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Twitter-Lifecycle-Email1.png" alt="Twitter-Lifecycle-Email" width="778" height="487"></p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need to use numbers. Three bullet points or sub-headers can work as well. HOLSTEE keeps it simple with plain and links.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7458" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HOLSTEE-123-email-21.jpg" alt="HOLSTEE 123 email 2" width="816" height="403"></p>
<p>While three might be the optimal number for some, the format is more important than the actual number. The key is to not overload people with information or tasks. Sticker Mule uses four to good effect.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7459" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sticker-mule-123-email1.jpg" alt="sticker mule 123 email" width="804" height="311"></p>
<p>The strategy works in HTML emails as well. Pinterest provides three simple steps to get new users started. As a business built on visuals, their emails stay consistent with their branding and imagery.</p>

<h2><div class="toc title green" id="22."><h2><span class="number"> 22. </span><span class="title">Use the Inverted Pyramid Method.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>There are a lot of things that <em>get in the way</em> of a great email. Copy, content and design come to mind. That sounds counterintuitive, but users need as little friction as possible. We came up with a simple model called <a href="/resources/inverted-pyramid-method/">the Inverted Pyramid Method</a> to help keep your emails focused.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7461" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Inverted-Pyramid-Method1.jpg" alt="Inverted-Pyramid-Method" width="680" height="580"></p>
<p>Highly focused emails don&rsquo;t rely on design, images or copy. They rely on tone, timing and clarity. And that creates a real advantage for businesses smart enough to send them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some examples. (And in case you haven&rsquo;t seen this before, <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Costco-Email-Example.jpg">here&rsquo;s a good example of what <strong>not</strong> to do</a>.)</p>
<p>Nike puts this strategy to good use in a Black Friday email. They grab your attention, then guide your eyes towards the button. There is nowhere to get lost in this email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7462" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/sumome/authtoken/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/authtoken.png?fit=1292%2C935&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1292,935" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="authtoken" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/authtoken.png?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/authtoken.png?fit=1024%2C741&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7462" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nike-inverted-pyramid1.jpg" alt="nike inverted pyramid" width="789" height="1105"></p>
<p>Help Scout takes the strategy even more literally. Like Nike, there is very little copy &ndash; just 32 words including the button text. Every word brings the user a little closer to click.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7463" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/help-scout-inverted-pyramid-method1.jpg" alt="help scout inverted pyramid method" width="788" height="926"></p>
<p>Often, less is more. Use the Inverted Pyramid Method when you need your emails to spark action.</p>
<div class="toc title red" id="23."><h2><span class="number"> 23. </span><span class="title">Go for small wins.</span></h2></div>
<p>Your business &ndash; and every business for that matter &ndash; is powered by small wins. Marketers often ask for too much from potential customers. Big wins like conversions and upgrades are earned over time. Don&rsquo;t be surprised when you ask your email subscribers to upgrade and only 0.001% convert. Instead, think about building momentum. Asking subscribers to read a blog post or follow you on Twitter is a bigger deal than you think. And though it&rsquo;s a small win, it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7464" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/vero-conversion-optimization1.jpg" alt="vero-conversion-optimization" width="800" height="436"></p>
<p>The <a href="/resources/small-wins/">Small Win Email</a> is one that asks the recipient to take a minor step. This strategy is particularly useful in onboarding campaigns and newsletters. Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>Brian Dean asks new subscribers to reply to his <a href="/resources/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a> with something they are struggling with. This doesn&rsquo;t drive sales, but it does give him really useful data for future marketing.</p>

<p><a href="/resources/guides/death-to-the-stock-photo/">Death to the Stock Photo</a> offers a premium plan, but that&rsquo;s not what they&rsquo;re selling here. As a stock photo company, Instagram is the perfect platform to engage with their users.</p>

<h2><div class="toc title blue-gray" id="24."><h2><span class="number"> 24. </span><span class="title">Send a 'squeeze' email.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using event tracking to start and <a href="/resources/stop-your-campaigns">stop your email campaigns</a>, a squeeze situation is common. It happens when a user is stuck between two events.</p>
<p>Abandoned cart emails are a good example. A customer adds items to their cart but doesn&rsquo;t check out. This strategy is highly useful for SaaS businesses as well.</p>
<p>Take Strava. If a user has `Signed up` but hasn&rsquo;t `Recorded first run`, the marketing team can create a segment of people that triggered the first event, but not the second. Those people fall into a very specific place in the customer lifecycle, so they can be sent highly targeted emails. In the example below, Strava asks users who have yet to record a run to enter a monthly challenge.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7467" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/migrating-to-vero-from-mandrill/monkeyhands_2x/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monkeyhands_2x.png?fit=1140%2C620&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1140,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="monkeyhands_2x" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monkeyhands_2x.png?fit=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/monkeyhands_2x.png?fit=1024%2C557&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7467" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/strava-squeeze-email1.jpg" alt="strava squeeze email" width="730" height="767"></p>
<p><a href="/resources/the-retention-email/">Airbnb&rsquo;s retention email</a> is another classic example <a href="/resources/airbnb/">we&rsquo;ve talked about several times</a> on this blog. When a user <code>Views listings</code> but doesn&rsquo;t book, they send an email with recommendations in the same area and price range.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/airbnb-email11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7468" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/airbnb-email11.jpg" alt="airbnb-email1" width="800" height="1677"></a></p>
<p>Once you dive into event tracking, it&rsquo;s a good idea to track as many events as you can. You&rsquo;ll start to find that users are almost constantly between two events, which give you the chance to send a targeted squeeze email.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title orange" id="25."><h2><span class="number"> 25. </span><span class="title">Send emails in the right time zone.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of prioritizing one time zone over another.</p>
<p>Most marketers approach email timing this way and it&rsquo;s far less than ideal. They test send times, then choose the single time that delivers the most opens and clicks. That only works if you customers are all in the same time zone. Otherwise, there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>
<p><a href="/resources/time-zone-management">Vero&rsquo;s time zone feature</a> allows you to send newsletters and campaigns to users in their own time zone. Instead of dropping an email at 10 am in New York and 11 pm in Singapore, your emails can arrive at 10 am regardless of the user&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="561px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7469" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/vero-time-zone-scheduling1.png" alt="vero-time-zone-scheduling" width="561" height="432"></p>
<h2><div class="toc title purple" id="26."><h2><span class="number"> 26. </span><span class="title">Personalize with dynamic content.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>This topic can be a rabbit hole, so let me quickly show you the four levels or content personalization:</p>
<p><strong>Segments and Static Content</strong></p>
<p>Divvy up your lists into segments and send content based on the group&rsquo;s common interest. This is the baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Insert Basic Customer Merge Tags</strong></p>
<p>Merge tags are placeholders that are replaced by actual content when the email is sent. <code>Hey {{user.name}}!</code> becomes &ldquo;Hey Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Collect and Insert On-Site Data</strong></p>
<p>Use a tool like Vero to capture events &ndash; pages viewed, product usage, etc. &ndash; then use insert event attributes &ndash; product images and details, URLs, etc. &ndash; into your emails.</p>
<p>Abandoned cart emails are a good example of using this on-site activity. An event is tracked &ndash; <code>Viewed Cart</code> &ndash; with an event attribute that is an array of all the items in their cart &ndash; including, for example, a `6&Prime; Service Boot`. You can use the event to trigger the email &ndash; <em>Send after 24 hours of inactivity</em> &ndash; and use the event attribute to populate the product field. You can even use the product image (another event property) in the email.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7470" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/huckberry-abandoned-cart1.jpg" alt="huckberry-abandoned-cart" width="799" height="648"></p>
<p><strong>Pull Data From Your Own Database</strong></p>
<p>This is where dynamic content gets really interesting. We&rsquo;ll use Vero customer Uniplaces as an example.</p>
<p>Uniplaces is a marketplace for students to book accommodations and for landlords to find tenants. When users sign up and begin searching for a house or apartment, Uniplaces tracks events and event properties that allow them to send impressive email campaigns.</p>
<p>When a logged-in user views a listing, they record an event &ndash; <code>Views listing</code> &ndash; and an event property &ndash; <code>event.city</code>. If the user fails to complete the next event &ndash; <code>Completes booking</code> &ndash; Uniplaces sends an email with suggested listings.</p>
<p>This is done by pulling in data from an external API (<a href="/resources/dynamic-content">which you can read all about here</a>).</p>

<h2><div class="toc title orange" id="27."><h2><span class="number"> 27. </span><span class="title">Leverage the Zeigarnik Effect.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik&rsquo;s research shows that humans are bothered by loose ends. The Zeigarnik Effect is that uncomfortable feeling we get when things are left unfinished. That could be the cliffhanger in a season finale of your favorite TV show or the half-written proposal that&rsquo;s been sitting on your desk for a week.</p>
<p>The Zeigarnik Effect is not only easy to understand &ndash; we&rsquo;ve all experienced and acted on those feelings &ndash; it&rsquo;s also easy to apply to email marketing.</p>
<p>The easiest place to start is progress bars. These provide context to your user &ndash; it helps them understand where they are in a process and how much more there is left to accomplish.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="590px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7472" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Zeigarnik-Effect-111.png" alt="Zeigarnik-Effect-11" width="590" height="272"></p>
<p>Evernote employs a low-tech version of this in the subject lines of their onboarding emails.</p>

<h2><div class="toc title blue-gray" id="28."><h2><span class="number"> 28. </span><span class="title">Send a recurring email.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Recurring emails are an extension of your product. They usually arrive in the form of a usage report and they <strong>cannot</strong> be treated like promotional emails. Without a clear focus on user experience, recurring emails are guaranteed to fall flat on their face.</p>
<p>Grammarly sends one of the best recurring emails we&rsquo;ve ever seen. We liked it so much <a href="/resources/grammarly">we wrote an entire case study on this one email</a>. They pull data from their users&rsquo; weekly activity and summarize it in an email. This is the only place Grammarly users get these metrics, so it&rsquo;s truly an extension of the product.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weekly reports product is meant to be our bread and butter from an email perspective,&rdquo; says Grammarly&rsquo;s head of product marketing Drew Price. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a retention/engagement hybrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to presenting the data, you can use it to make recommendations for unused features or new products. If Grammarly notices I&rsquo;ve made a few mistakes with commas, they recommend content to educate me on proper usage.</p>

<p>Or, if they record no data at all, a retention email arrives in place of the report.</p>

<h2><div class="toc title blue" id="29."><h2><span class="number"> 29. </span><span class="title">Use the Unboxing Technique.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Consumer anxiety is the baseline. If you work in marketing, this is your starting point. Your potential customers are skeptical of you, your product and your claim that it will make their life easier.</p>
<p><strong>The key to solving almost all anxiety is clarity.</strong> If people know what to expect, they are more likely to kick the tires and ultimately become a customer. That&rsquo;s where <a href="/resources/the-unboxing-technique">the Unboxing Technique</a> comes into play. This simple strategy involves previewing your product or service right in the inbox.</p>
<p>Dollar Shave Club is a good example. They literally unbox their product in their promotional emails.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7478" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DSC_retention_email2.jpg" alt="DSC_retention_email" width="724" height="1278"></p>
<p>You can do this with software too. Elevate shows previews of their mobile app to give new users an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7479" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/elevate-unboxing-email1.jpg" alt="elevate-unboxing-email" width="764" height="2459"></p>
<p>Gumroad does the same thing, but uses a GIF to give a quick demonstration.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7480" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gumroad-unboxing1.gif" alt="gumroad-unboxing" width="758" height="519"></p>
<h2><div class="toc title red" id="30."><h2><span class="number"> 30. </span><span class="title">Segment on signup.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Any and all data should be used to personalize your emails. When it comes to newsletters, it&rsquo;s a good idea to ask a few simple questions even if you aren&rsquo;t ready to use the data just yet.</p>
<p>Strava is a simple example. Their tool helps runners and cyclists track their workouts. When new users signup, Strava asks if they prefer to run or ride.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="582px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7481" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/strava-onboarding1.png" alt="strava-onboarding" width="582" height="401"></p>
<p>Then, they send sport-specific follow-up emails.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7482" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/strava-product-update-email1.jpg" alt="strava-product-update-email" width="707" height="1321"></p>
<p>Airbnb does the same thing when people inquire about their business travel program.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="379px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7483" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/airbnb-business-travel1.png" alt="airbnb business travel" width="379" height="411"></p>
<p>IKEA takes segmentation very seriously. When you subscribe to their newsletter, they ask a series of optional questions. (This is just the tip of the iceberg. <a href="/resources/ikea/">See the full series here.</a>)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7484" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IKEA-segmentation-11.png" alt="IKEA-segmentation-1" width="800" height="538"></p>
<p>The more you know, the more relevant the emails can be.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title green" id="31."><h2><span class="number"> 31. </span><span class="title">Measure campaigns with scatter plots.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to visualize the success or failure of an email campaign. Pulling data into a spreadsheet makes this much easier. Here&rsquo;s a look at a process we use internally to measure our email campaigns.</p>
<p>First, pull a few data points into a spreadsheet. You&rsquo;ll need the time delay (i.e. when was the email sent), open rate and click rate.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="403px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7485" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/vero-email-marketing-blog-campaign1.png" alt="vero-email-marketing-blog-campaign" width="403" height="302"></p>
<p>Using the chart feature in Google Sheets, create a simple graph where the time is represented by the X-axis and open/click rates by the Y-axis. Then, use a polynomial trendline in the Customization tab to create a scatter chart.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="368px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7486" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/trendline1.png" alt="trendline" width="368" height="179"></p>
<p>The final result will look something like this:</p>
<p class=" aspect-ratio"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnaIcFqem7KDieh-2f0QjZvmU75CtglN5eZvOtAmtyA/pubchart?oid=662452951&amp;format=interactive" width="600" height="371" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a great way to visualize momentum. Look for emails with low open rates and aim for better subject lines and more interesting content or calls to action. You can borrow a few best practices from this very post &ndash; social proof, the Zeigarnik Effect or the Unboxing Technique to name a few &ndash; to boost click and conversion rates.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title red" id="32."><h2><span class="number"> 32. </span><span class="title">Steal like an artist.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to start building an email campaign from scratch. When you need a bit of inspiration for a new campaign, just look at the great brands already in your inbox.</p>
<p>Set up a label (in Gmail) or folder in your inbox and title it &ldquo;Swipe File.&rdquo; Anytime you see a great subject line, a good offer, a beautiful design or great copy, just add the message to your swipe file. Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll have a repository of inspiration that you can tap into when you are working on your own campaigns.</p>
<p>To make this even more powerful, set up individual labels or folders depending on why the email caught your attention. Example: Create a folder for &ldquo;Great Subject Lines&rdquo; so you&rsquo;ll always remember why you set aside the email for later. Add a few emails each day and, soon, you&rsquo;ll have hundreds of ideas for writing better emails.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how my swipe file looks:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="169px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7487" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/swipe-file-example1.png" alt="swipe-file-example" width="169" height="179"></p>
<p>When you receive behavioral emails, spend a few minutes reverse-engineering them. Why did you receive it? Where did the data come from? How long after your last interaction was it sent?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t re-invent the wheel when your own inbox is already full of good ideas.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title blue" id="33."><h2><span class="number"> 33. </span><span class="title">Stop campaigns.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Autoresponders are a gift to email marketers <em>when they are used correctly</em>. The primary challenge is that emails are sent on a schedule regardless of what the user does in the meantime.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7488" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Autoresponder@2x1.png" alt="Autoresponder@2x" width="800" height="435"></p>
<p>Imagine if Twitter sent a welcome campaign without accounting for each new user&rsquo;s behavior.</p>
<ul><li>Day 1: Welcome!</li>
<li>Day 2: Here&rsquo;s some popular people to follow</li>
<li>Day 3: Send your first tweet</li>
<li>Day 4: How to use and follow hashtags</li>
</ul><p>If the user signs up, follows a few friends and sends a tweet on day one, the entire campaign is rendered irrelevant. This creates a bad user experience.</p>
<p>To prevent irrelevant emails, consider stopping your campaigns when users take certain actions. Vero customers can use our conditional filters to remove users before each send.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="548px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7489" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/vero-campaign-conditions1.png" alt="vero-campaign-conditions" width="548" height="342"></p>
<p>Stopping is the new starting. Instead of sending tons of emails, send a handful of highly targeted, relevant messages.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title purple" id="34."><h2><span class="number"> 34. </span><span class="title">Send at least one great retention email.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Whether you run a blog or an online store, retention is a constant concern. You can use email to plug holes in your funnel and keep users engaged.</p>
<p>We recommend starting with a single <a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">great retention email</a>. By creating just one, you&rsquo;ll learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Before you create a series of retention emails for all your customers, find a place where you&rsquo;re weak and run a few tests.</p>
<p>A great place to start is inactivity. Use Vero or another tool to track logins, then trigger emails when a user has been inactive for 28 days. This segment will look something like this:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7490" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Monitor-Inactivity1.jpg" alt="Monitor-Inactivity" width="800" height="236"></p>
<p>As users enter this segment, you can trigger a retention email. If you need some inspiration, <a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">check out these 15 examples</a>.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title orange" id="35."><h2><span class="number"> 35. </span><span class="title">Integrate with social media.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>There are <a href="/resources/6-creative-ways-to-integrate-social-media-and-email-marketing/">a number of ways to integrate email and social media</a>, but here&rsquo;s a look at one of our favorites: retargeting subscribers on Facebook.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is queue up a great email. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re offering a free trial to people who downloaded an e-book. Segment your list in your email provider and get the content ready to send.</p>
<p>Use Google&rsquo;s URL Builder to add parameters to any links in the email. As an example, you could use <code>freetrialoffer</code> as the campaign source, <code>email</code> as the medium and <code>retargeting</code> as the campaign name. Append these parameters to the links in your email. It will look like this: <code>/?utm_source=freetrialoffer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=retargeting</code></p>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need a tool like <a href="http://www.perfectaudience.com/">Perfect Audience</a>. Use the querystring filter to identify people that came from your campaign and show them targeted ads based on your offer.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7491" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/22-perfect-audience-create-list1.jpg" alt="22-perfect-audience-create-list" width="650" height="503"></p>

<h2><div class="toc title blue" id="36."><h2><span class="number"> 36. </span><span class="title">Replenish.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Hardly anyone is using the replenishment email strategy. And if you sell items that need to be replenished, you are leaving recurring revenue on the table.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll look at a few examples but first, <strong>what exactly is a replenishment email?</strong></p>
<p>A replenishment email is one that simply reminds customers to re-order items when they run out. If you buy dog food from Petco, they should (but don&rsquo;t) remind you to order more based on the size of the last bag you ordered.</p>
<p>ProFlowers is one business that has replenishment emails down to a science. They know that flowers are often given as gifts for birthdays and holidays. These occasions occur on a regular basis, meaning ProFlowers can predict when you&rsquo;ll need to order again.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7492" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/proflowers-replenishment-email1.jpg" alt="proflowers-replenishment-email" width="795" height="927"></p>
<p>The key is to provide a helpful cue at just the right moment. This is low-hanging fruit for almost any business, whether you sell holiday gifts, monthly or annual subscription plans, or even consulting.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title purple" id="37."><h2><span class="number"> 37. </span><span class="title">Ask people to reply.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Email is a platform for two-way communication. Unlike other forms of marketing and advertising &ndash; television, podcast and banner ads to name a few &ndash; users are actually used to responding to emails.</p>
<p>Asking people to reply to your emails is a tactic that doesn&rsquo;t scale, but you can learn a ton in the process. Here&rsquo;s an example of an email we automate when new users start their first campaign:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7493" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/vero-ask-people-to-reply1.jpg" alt="vero-ask-people-to-reply" width="655" height="296"></p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t solicit replies, you can let people know that you accept replies. FullContact bucks the trend of sending from a &ldquo;noreply@company&rdquo; address and sends their <a href="/resources/product-update-emails">product update emails</a> from &ldquo;pleasereply@fullcontact.com.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7494" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/full-contact-please-reply1.jpg" alt="full contact please reply" width="750" height="508"></p>
<p>People are likely already responding to your emails. If you aren&rsquo;t checking those responses, track them down. If you send a weekly newsletter to thousands of people, there is intel in those responses that can help you close leads and improve your content.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7495" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/email-replies-vero1.jpg" alt="email-replies-vero" width="760" height="288"></p>
<p>At Vero, we filter responses to our newsletter through Help Scout so that we can assign the right team member to handle each one. Most responses are &ldquo;Out of Office&rdquo; replies but each week, we find a few people who need help getting started with Vero or have ideas for improving the newsletter.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title green" id="38."><h2><span class="number"> 38. </span><span class="title">Send progressively smarter emails.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Every email you send should be better than the last.</p>
<p>TripAdvisor&rsquo;s emails get progressively better as they learn more about each user. New users receive generalized information based on the little TripAdvisor knows about them. Take this email, for example, which suggests destinations based on my home airport.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7496" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/1-TripAdvisor21.jpg" alt="1-TripAdvisor2" width="740" height="1484"></p>
<p>Knowing where I&rsquo;m traveling <em>from</em> is a good start, but it&rsquo;s the destination that matters. TripAdvisor can show me where to stay and how to get there if they can figure out <em>where</em> I&rsquo;m headed. As they collect data from on-site behavior and email clicks, the emails start to get smarter.</p>
<p>Once they can be reasonably sure about the destination, emails like this one begin to arrive.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7497" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/5-TripAdvisor21.jpg" alt="5-TripAdvisor2" width="740" height="1230"></p>
<p>Then, price alerts based on the destination and dates.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7498" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/release-notes/14-november-2016/new-campaign-flow/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/new-campaign-flow-1.gif?fit=1876%2C943&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1876,943" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="new-campaign-flow" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/new-campaign-flow-1.gif?fit=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/new-campaign-flow-1.gif?fit=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7498" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/6-TripAdvisor1.jpg" alt="6-TripAdvisor" width="740" height="535"></p>
<p>Soon, they are suggesting restaurants and activities, inquiring about reviews and suggesting more destinations based on your Facbeook friends&rsquo; activity. In our epic <a href="/resources/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">TripAdvisor case study</a>, we looked at 20 emails to see how they were applying their learnings to subsequent emails. It was incredible to watch the emails get more and more refined &ndash; <a href="/resources/guides/tripadvisors-unfair-advantage/">dive into it here</a>.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title red" id="39."><h2><span class="number"> 39. </span><span class="title">Use all the data.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to behavioral email, here is a quick primer on capturing events.</p>
<p>When you record an event &ndash; let&rsquo;s say <code>viewed product</code> for example &ndash; you can also collect event attributes. If an event is a noun, attributes are all the adjectives that describe it. Here are just a few examples of attributes you can collect based on the event <code>viewed product</code>:</p>
<ul><li>sku number</li>
<li>product name</li>
<li>product color</li>
<li>product price</li>
<li>product image</li>
<li>product category</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>location</li>
<li>URL string</li>
<li>referring page or source</li>
</ul><p>All of this data is recorded with the event and added to the user&rsquo;s profile. From here, you can insert attributes in an email &ndash; imagine referencing a product&rsquo;s image, color and price &ndash; and use it to build segments &ndash; think of creating a segment of all users who have viewed purple shoes in the last 14 days.</p>
<p>When it comes to recording data, don&rsquo;t be shy. Record as much as you can now so you can put it to good use later.</p>
<h2><div class="toc title blue-gray" id="40."><h2><span class="number"> 40. </span><span class="title">Hold yourself to a high standard.</span></h2></div></h2>
<p>Do you watch TV for the commercials?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Do you check email for marketing newsletters?</p>
<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p>As Samuel Hulick <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/blog/lifecycle-emails/">wrote on the Help Scout blog</a>, &ldquo;On the highway to user/product love, [emails] are road signs providing timely guidance, not annoying billboards.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Email isn&rsquo;t about selling.</strong> Receiving marketing materials is a side effect of our dependence on email.</p>
<p>Despite all you&rsquo;ve heard about email as a channel, it&rsquo;s just a platform for communication. It&rsquo;s a great place to learn about what your leads and customers want and provide helpful cues.</p>
<p>Hold yourself to the highest standard when it comes to sending marketing emails. Focus on identifying pain points in the customer lifecycle and using email as an extension of your product or service. The more helpful you are, the more you&rsquo;ll be rewarded.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p class="lead">Data-driven marketing can be sophisticated, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has to be complex.</p>
<p>Email is a medium that tends to get overcomplicated. It&rsquo;s understandable &ndash; most marketers are managing more than one email tool, dozens of lists of thousands of users. But there is some good news about email personalization &ndash; it&rsquo;s more straightforward than you think. In fact, there are really only three ways to personalize an email. I&rsquo;ll go over each, with a few examples and more detail in this post.</p>
<h2>Personalize with Content</h2>
<p>This is the first and most obvious way to personalize an email. Your goal is to get as close to 1-to-1 messaging as possible. There are a few ways to achieve this.</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m going to gloss over the finer details since <a href="/resources/dynamic-content">we just wrote about this last week</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Basic segmentation</strong></p>
<p>This applies mostly to newsletters. By making it very clear who the email is for, you are essentially segmenting the list. <a href="https://iosdevweekly.com/">iOS Dev Weekly</a> is a good example &ndash; there&rsquo;s no way the wrong people end up on this list, so the content is at least broadly personalized.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Tags</strong></p>
<p>These placeholders are replaced by names, usernames, birthdays and other basic user data at send time.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>Hey {{user.name}}!</code> becomes &ldquo;Hey Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can also use Liquid templates to get more sophisticated. For example, you can use Liquid to pull any user data from Vero into an email.</p>
<p><strong>External Attributes</strong></p>
<p>This is the bread and butter of the world&rsquo;s best email marketers. External attributes is a Vero feature that pulls data from an external API into your emails. If you want to suggest products, send contextual retention emails or capture abandoned carts, this is how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p><a href="/resources/dynamic-content">Read more on content personalization.</a></p>
<h2>Personalize with Timing</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of email, there are two ways to optimize the time an email arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong></p>
<p>Assuming you&rsquo;ve already segmented by user interest, the next step is identifying the optimal time to send your message. This is done by testing days of the week and time of day. This is common practice but there&rsquo;s a forgotten variable that most marketers overlook: time zones.</p>
<p>Prioritizing your most popular time zone is a mistake. What about the people in other time zones? If a segment responds well to a newsletter at 10am on Tuesday, you can ensure <em>everyone</em> receives it then with our timezone management feature.</p>

<p><strong>Lifecycle/Behavioral Emails</strong></p>
<p>Emails that are sent as part of campaign rely on timing as well. While time of the day/week is important, the user&rsquo;s place in the <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">customer lifecycle</a> is more important.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t send an email asking a customer to write a review until they&rsquo;ve had a chance to use your product. Amazon, for example, triggers an event when you finish a Kindle book. They use that to send the email that asks you to review it. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of sending an email at the right moment.</p>

<p>Personalize with Segments<br>
Once you say goodbye to lists, personalization gets so much easier.</p>
<p>Segments are sets of users grouped by condition. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Customers that are tagged with VIP</li>
<li>Customers that haven&rsquo;t tried feature X</li>
<li>Blog subscribers that have read at least two articles</li>
<li>Users who played Level 1 but not Level 2</li>
<li>Customers who signed in with Facebook</li>
</ul><p>The list goes on and on. Here&rsquo;s what the segment builder looks like in Vero:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s flexible and powerful. Segments are the core of our email tool because it&rsquo;s by far the best way to group users. Plus, they update in real-time. SO if a user no longer meets the conditions, they are removed.</p>

<h3>The Perfect Email</h3>
<p>Once you stop thinking about &ldquo;blasting&rdquo; your users and start thinking about getting as close to 1-to-1 personalization as possible, email becomes much more powerful. The companies that treat email like an extension of their product and not a marketing channel excel at email. And their users reward them for it.</p>

<html><body><p class="lead">Your customers are inundated with hundreds of messages every day. The signal to noise ratio is lower than ever.</p>
<p>But somehow, a handful of businesses manage to stand out in the inbox. Some rely on data to monitor behavior and trigger messages. Others invest in good, old-fashioned branding. Still others make their mark with great copywriting. There is no <em>right</em> way but there are plenty of wrong ones.</p>
<p>Regardless of your approach &ndash; and all three can work in any industry &ndash; there&rsquo;s a fine line between emails that improve your customers&rsquo; experience and emails that hurt it.</p>
<p>Take Zazzle for example. A few months back, <a href="/resources/shipping-confirmation-emails/" target="_blank">we wrote about their excellent shipping confirmation email</a>. The experience started off on the right foot but it&rsquo;s since devolved into an endless series of coupons and limited offers. (For the uninitiated, Zazzle is a platform that lets you customize t-shirts, mugs, hats and just about anything else. It&rsquo;s also a platform for makers and artists to sell their products. <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/about" target="_blank">And they use robots for all their product photography.</a>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve received 243 emails in the 251 days since my first (and only) purchase.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7070" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="831,244" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?fit=831%2C244&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7070" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png" alt="zazzle emails" width="831" height="244" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?w=831&amp;ssl=1 831w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-emails.png?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px"></p>
<p>I had a great experience on their site but now, I&rsquo;m flooded with offers for everything from throw pillows to smartphone cases. The emails look great and the copy is sharp, but the overall effect is hurtful. Zazzle has commoditized their brand.</p>
<h2>How Zazzle Could Improve Their Email Strategy</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy for an outsider to offer blanket advice like &ldquo;send less email.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vero CEO Chris Hexton offered an interesting perspective. &ldquo;If this gets results for Zazzle, should they send fewer emails?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If a key driver of their business model is these daily deals, then perhaps this strategy could be working very well. Maybe it really is the best approach for them. &rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is it <em>has</em> worked well.</p>
<p>Zazzle <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">netted around $250 million</a> in FY2015, a 25 percent increase over 2014. &ldquo;Just because we don&rsquo;t love the business model doesn&rsquo;t mean we can hate on the strategy,&rdquo; Chris reminded me.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/29/the-anti-amazon-thats-making-money-zazzle.html">CNBC profile</a> emphasized that Zazzle is &ldquo;doing something crazy by Silicon Valley standards: generating profit.&rdquo; No e-commerce company &ndash; except, perhaps, Amazon &ndash; can afford to forgo profits while they build a platform, audience or brand. Whatever Zazzle is doing clearly works.</p>
<p>That said, daily &ldquo;spray and pray&rdquo; emails aren&rsquo;t always the best way to appeal to customers. We like Zazzle and we&rsquo;re fans of businesses actually pursuing revenue. So we pose this question: <strong>How can Zazzle send fewer emails and make more money?</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few ideas.</p>
<h3>Ask for more customer information and use it.</h3>
<p>I went digging around my Zazzle account and found that you can complete a profile. This information is the key to better marketing. But I&rsquo;ve never been asked to fill it out.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="276px"><img data-attachment-id="7091" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/zazzle-profile/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="276,291" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zazzle profile" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png?fit=276%2C291&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7091" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zazzle-profile.png" alt="zazzle profile" width="276" height="291"></p>
<p>I made my first purchase on Zazzle because I wanted a custom t-shirt. They delivered and I was a happy customer. But a few days after the order shipped, the onslaught of emails began. I immediately (and subconsciously) started ignoring their marketing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s smart to capitalize on the momentum of a first purchase. Instead of telling new customers about the next sale, what if Zazzle offered $5 off the next purchase in exchange for a completed profile? That would give them access to gender, location, age, social profiles and more.</p>
<p>Data like this unlocks an opportunity for better email.</p>

<p>Lots of SaaS companies, like Twitter, use sign-up momentum to collect basic demographic data. E-commerce businesses like Zazzle can borrow inspiration from their SaaS peers.</p>

<p>Pinterest users might be interested in their <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">Pinterest boards</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t one-to-one email marketing but it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction. Personalized offers are more compelling than exclusive discounts and weekend sales. The more Zazzle gets to know their customers, the more focused their marketing can be.</p>
<p>Imagine how nice it would be to surprise customers with relevant emails instead of hammering them with offers.</p>
<h3>Automate follow-up emails based on behavior.</h3>
<p><a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">Inactivity and retention emails</a> are the bread and butter of most SaaS email campaigns. Without recurring subscription revenue, e-commerce businesses need to spend even more time thinking about customer retention.</p>
<p>There are <a href="/resources/triggered-retention-emails/">three different types of inactivity</a>: initial, partial and complete. The relationship begins with an event like a purchase or email signup and customers should receive different types of emails based on how long they&rsquo;ve been inactive.</p>
<p>In each case, behavioral emails work well because campaigns can start or stop depending the customers&rsquo; activity (or lack thereof). Here are examples of each.</p>
<p><strong>Initial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>A customer makes a purchase but doesn&rsquo;t view any additional products within two weeks. Go for the small win by asking them to follow you on Pinterest, write a product review, check out related products or see curated products on a blog.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7168" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/airbnb-curated-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="693,855" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="airbnb curated email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?fit=693%2C855&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7168" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg" alt="airbnb curated email" width="693" height="855" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?w=693&amp;ssl=1 693w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/airbnb-curated-email.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px"></p>
<p>Airbnb is a good example. They curate popular listings for inactive customers.</p>
<p>If customers show interest in a listing, <a href="/resources/the-retention-email/">Airbnb sends specific follow-up emails</a>. Everything here is automated. The curated emails generate activity, which can be used to send more targeted messages.</p>
<p><strong>Partial inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>As time passes without a repeat purchase, emails tend include more urgency and deeper discounts. That&rsquo;s one way to do it. But with more data, it&rsquo;s easy to send targeted emails.</p>

<p>Take ProFlowers for example. Knowing that most customers are buying gifts, they send these helpful reminders. I hadn&rsquo;t used ProFlowers in a year but upon receipt of this email, made another purchase. This is called a <a href="/resources/replenishment-email/">replenishment email</a> and it&rsquo;s one of the most under-utilized forms of e-commerce marketing.</p>
<p>Product updates are another way to engage partially inactive customers. If something new or exciting has happened since the customer last visited your site, let them know via email.</p>

<p><strong>Complete inactivity:</strong></p>
<p>As the months go on, it&rsquo;s time to make one last offer and say goodbye.</p>

<p>You can try a &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; email to make a really compelling offer.</p>
<p>Remember though &ndash; if you&rsquo;ve toned down the frequency of your marketing emails, &ldquo;Hail Mary&rdquo; emails stand out. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re just another email that gets lost in the mix.</p>
<h3>Use content, not products, to drive engagement.</h3>
<p>Evernote has a problem. Their software is a blank slate. It can be used for so many things but every new customer starts at the same place: square one.</p>
<p>Zazzle has a similar problem. Because customers can customize products, the possibilities are endless. This is where content can provide inspiration. Evernote uses case studies and product updates to show users how to use their software. Zazzle does a bit of this <a href="http://blog.zazzle.com/2015/10/06/3-killer-halloween-party-themes-decor-ideas/">on their blog</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/zazzle/">on Pinterest</a> but it&rsquo;s hidden in the footers of their emails.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7204" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/email-footer-zazzle/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?fit=658%2C207&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="658,207" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="email footer zazzle" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?fit=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?fit=658%2C207&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7204" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png" alt="email footer zazzle" width="658" height="207" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?w=658&amp;ssl=1 658w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/email-footer-zazzle.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px"></p>
<p>Their goal is move products, not drive pageviews. But it&rsquo;s hard to sell to the same customers every day. Content could dive into seasonal events, showcase what other customers are doing and provide visual inspiration for home decor and gifts.</p>

<p>Evernote leads with content but shows how their product can help users achieve their goals.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7216" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/quality-over-quantity/spartan-newsletter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/spartan-newsletter.jpg?fit=856%2C642&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="856,642" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="spartan newsletter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/spartan-newsletter.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/spartan-newsletter.jpg?fit=856%2C642&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7216" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/spartan-newsletter.jpg" alt="spartan newsletter" width="856" height="642" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/spartan-newsletter.jpg?w=856&amp;ssl=1 856w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/spartan-newsletter.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 856px) 100vw, 856px"></p>
<p>Spartan provides daily workouts in their newsletter. Instead of selling the adventure races all the time, they encourage fitness, then drive engaged users to races and other events.</p>
<p>Mixing content into Zazzle&rsquo;s email flow would break up the monotony of the sales-heavy emails and engage customers in a new way. Content also supports social media engagement and discovery. For e-commerce companies, it&rsquo;s part of a balanced marketing strategy.</p>

<p>The question we have to ask is <strong>what distinguishes</strong> those emails that <strong>do</strong> engage?</p>
<p>The answer is that we pay attention to emails that have <strong>context</strong> (one of our favourite words here at <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com">Vero</a>).</p>
<p>Good emails are not just random rows in the inbox &ndash; they are part of an end-to-end user experience that has continuity. The emails in the top 10% that drive interactions are, basically, <em>helpful</em>.</p>
<p>Product, design, marketing and engineering teams have to work together to create this sort of seamless user experience because great customer experiences infiltrate <strong>all</strong> elements of customers&rsquo; interactions with your business.</p>
<p>When I go to the Apple Genius Bar, they look my purchase history on their iPad, allowing them to be more <em>helpful</em> when working with me. This <strong>context</strong> helps Apple&rsquo;s support team (the Geniuses) to treat me as an individual.</p>
<p>Amazon knows that showing me the latest books in my favourite category is more <em>helpful</em> when I&rsquo;m selecting my next read than showing me a random selection. These recommendations have more <strong>context</strong>.</p>
<p>Trello knows that sending me an aggregate email of the mentions and activity I&rsquo;ve <strong>missed</strong> whilst offline is more <em>helpful</em> than sending me a single email with <strong>every</strong> activity (even those I saw online). After all, this email has a lot more <strong>context</strong>.</p>
<p>These sorts of experiences aren&rsquo;t an accident.</p>
<p>Email is a huge component of your customer interactions. Here at Vero, whenever we see businesses creating sub-par experiences, there are a few things that they tend to get wrong.</p>
<p>The following are the key principles I see the best Vero customers using time and again to send great emails. Emails that are <strong>part</strong> of a fantastic user experience.</p>
<h2 id="knowwhoyou'retalkingto">Know who you&rsquo;re talking to</h2>
<p>At Vero, one of the things we talk about most frequently is a single, holistic view of each of your customers.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t send something <em>helpful</em> if you don&rsquo;t know knowing anything about who you&rsquo;re emailing.</p>
<p>This sounds obvious &ndash; but for most businesses not using the right tools, answering questions like <em>&ldquo;Has the user been to your site before? Is this their first experience of your product? Do they regularly open emails? Have they paid you before?&rdquo;</em> is really hard.</p>
<p>Having the answers to these questions on hand, as actionable data stored against an individual customer&rsquo;s profile in a database, allows the best product and marketing teams to move quickly and tailor any campaign they send.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a really simple example of how we do this at Vero.</p>
<p>When the administrator at a Vero company invites a new user to their Vero account, we send that new user a welcome email.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t send the same email to every person that is invited. If you&rsquo;re invited to a Vero project as a <em>developer</em>, we won&rsquo;t send you the same content we&rsquo;d send a user that is invited as a <em>marketer</em>, and so on. We aim to be <em>helpful</em> by sending only the information that you need, not the information someone else on your team needs.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t do this if we didn&rsquo;t have the data to determine what type of user each specific recipient is. This is the reason we built Vero around a database, or CRM, rather than a list. Each individual user has a single record in Vero, and we append and update data, such as their <code>user_type</code> in real time.</p>
<p>We store the <code>user_type</code> with a value of <code>developer</code> (or <code>marketer</code> or <code>admin</code> and so on) at the moment the user is invited by their colleague. We can use the <code>user_type</code> to very clearly define what we should put in the email.</p>
<p>Basically, the data we store in Vero is gospel, and we store lots of data about each of our customers. Last week we spoke about how we are now using the data in Vero to improve our customer support experiences too, by integrating Vero and HelpScout. This means the exact same information that powers our automated emails shows up next to customer profiles in HelpScout, making sure our team has a lot more <strong>context</strong> when talking to customers, a bit like the Geniuses at the Apple store. <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/better-information-means-better-support/">Read more about this</a>.</p>
<p>By treating Vero as gospel, we are able to know who we are talking to at any given time.</p>
<h2 id="beconsistent">Be consistent</h2>
<p>The second most common thing that stops companies creating great user experiences is a lack of consistency.</p>
<p>To see a good example of a company that is consistent in their image and tone, check out Slack. They are amazing at using the same tone and design, in their product, in their emails, in their tweets, in their help articles &acirc;&#128;&#147; basically in everything they do.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some emails and tweets, to show you what I mean:</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="606px"><img data-attachment-id="7026" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-marketing-engagement/slack-weekly-email-summary/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-weekly-email-summary.png?fit=606%2C565&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="606,565" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="slack-weekly-email-summary" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-weekly-email-summary.png?fit=300%2C280&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-weekly-email-summary.png?fit=606%2C565&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7026" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-weekly-email-summary.png" alt="slack-weekly-email-summary" width="606" height="565" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-weekly-email-summary.png?w=606&amp;ssl=1 606w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-weekly-email-summary.png?resize=300%2C280&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"></p>
<p class=" small-image" style="518px"><img data-attachment-id="7027" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-marketing-engagement/slack-tweet/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-tweet.png?fit=518%2C184&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="518,184" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="slack-tweet" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-tweet.png?fit=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-tweet.png?fit=518%2C184&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7027" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-tweet.png" alt="slack-tweet" width="518" height="184" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-tweet.png?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slack-tweet.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px"></p>
<p>This consistency requires everyone across your company to know what your company stands for and to have access to the resources to make it happen.</p>
<p>In order to keep the design consistent in your emails, having a single place to store your templates, and a tool that allows you to change copy in any newsletter or automated campaign at any time is an important step to ensuring that every email you send is consistent.</p>
<p>At Vero, our emails are written by our product team, our growth team, our support team and our engineering team. Anyone can login and create an email, and everyone has access to the same set of templates. These templates can easily be reviewed and collaborated on by the various teams at Vero and this empowers everyone to talk more directly with our customers.</p>
<p>It also means we&rsquo;re more consistent. We can invest in design and ensure everyone benefits from it.</p>
<p>This is one of the key reasons we&rsquo;ve built Vero to handle all of your emails in one place and to give you an interface to manage and edit copy and design without having to update code.</p>
<p>You can send one-off newsletters, recurring daily/weekly/monthly emails, triggered product emails, transactional emails and more &ndash; all from the same interface. All of these campaigns can be built using the same templates and you can login and update the content of emails at any time, without requiring a fundamental code change or passing the work off to the engineering team.</p>
<p>This goes a long way to improving consistency and it&rsquo;s done wonders for us.</p>
<h3 id="don'tbombard">Don&rsquo;t bombard</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t email everyone, everything, all the time.</p>
<p>Sending multiple emails in the same day, or sending too many emails with different information simply irritates most people. There are exceptions to the rule but, most of the time, it makes you look disorganised or confused.</p>
<p>The best way to combat sending too much is to have a strategy. Having an over-arching strategy means you won&rsquo;t rush and it means you&rsquo;re more likely to send emails in a logical rhythm, rather than randomly.</p>
<p>You can enforce this with process and smart segmentation. A great example is the release cycle around a new product or feature. One of our customers, <a href="http://canva.com">Canva</a>, recently released the fantastic <a href="https://about.canva.com/work/">Canva for Work</a> and I really enjoyed the emails they sent me leading up to it.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="531px"><img data-attachment-id="7028" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/email-marketing-engagement/canva-email-canva-for-work/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/canva-email-canva-for-work.png?fit=531%2C820&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="531,820" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="canva-email-canva-for-work" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/canva-email-canva-for-work.png?fit=194%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/canva-email-canva-for-work.png?fit=531%2C820&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7028" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/canva-email-canva-for-work.png" alt="canva-email-canva-for-work" width="531" height="820" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/canva-email-canva-for-work.png?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/canva-email-canva-for-work.png?resize=194%2C300&amp;ssl=1 194w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px"></p>
<p>They sent these emails with a good cadence and each explained a new aspect of Canva. They took the recipient on a journey, and their emails complemented their updates on social media and other channels.</p>
<p>Using Vero enabled Canva to ensure they didn&rsquo;t send to many emails to specific groups of customers, or email the wrong group of users entirely, and helped them deliver on the launch of Canva for Work.</p>
<p>In Vero, you can send newsletters and automated emails, <strong>including</strong> transactional emails (receipts, invites, etc.) and this means you can easily filter out users that have received or interacted with an email recently &ndash; whether you want to filter out users who have opened any email, or even just those that have interacted with a specific email.</p>
<p>For many businesses, sending too often is an accident &ndash; it&rsquo;s hardly by design. This is why we&rsquo;ve put a lot of effort into capturing and storing what you send with Vero and making it possible for you to segment on this data. We&rsquo;re even making it easier for you to plug into Mailgun, Sendgrid, Mandrill and other transactional email platforms so you can still use these great services <strong>and</strong> capture the details in one place, helping prevent fatigue.</p>
<hr><p>Being in the top 10% of emails that really engage is about treating your customers with respect.</p>
<p>It might sound obvious but if you put time and effort into understanding who you&rsquo;re about to email, stay consistent and don&rsquo;t email too often then you&rsquo;ll really stand out from the crowd.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Creating great customer experiences is about delivering something useful to each individual customer, when it is actually useful.</p>
<p>This is all building a great company is really about: offering something useful to customers, to solve a problem when they need it.</p>
<p>For companies serious about creating this sort of experience &ndash; email is an integral part of their product. It&rsquo;s the part that ties your in-app or on-site activity to your inbox.</p>
<p>Time and again we see companies that think like this outperforming the benchmark. The hard fact is that just two out of every 10 people actually open emails that arrive in their inbox. Last week we did a case study on Grammarly, who take email extremely seriously and view it as a part of their actual software product. The usage reports and other emails they deliver form an integral part of their vision to help customers track the words they write.</p>
<p>Without them, their product would be less useful.</p>
<p>Today, we&rsquo;re going to take a look at some other companies who lead by example and use recurring emails (emails on a regular schedule), particularly usage reports, to actually craft a great experience, not just fill up people&rsquo;s inboxes.</p>
<h2>What is a recurring email?</h2>
<p>Recurring emails, like usage reports, are emails sent on a regular schedule. They can be used for all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Grammarly&rsquo;s emails are a great example of recurring content, that provide real value. They have turned email reports into the bedrock of their product strategy. The prime example, sent each Monday, is below. In this recurring email, users receive an email with all the details about their writing.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="580px"><img data-attachment-id="6978" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/recurring-emails/grammarly-email-product/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-email-product.png?fit=580%2C722&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="580,722" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly email product" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-email-product.png?fit=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-email-product.png?fit=580%2C722&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6978" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-email-product.png" alt="grammarly email product" width="580" height="722" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-email-product.png?w=580&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-email-product.png?resize=241%2C300&amp;ssl=1 241w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></p>
<p>These emails are sophisticated. The personalized report is the foundation &ndash; this is how Grammarly users measure their progress &ndash; but it also opens the door for highly targeted marketing.</p>
<blockquote class="snippet"><p>Read <strong>all of the details</strong> about Grammarly&rsquo;s email strategy in our post from last week: <a href="/resources/grammarly">How Grammarly Built an Email Product Users Love</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grammarly serves content based on each users&rsquo; writing mistakes. Users who make more than 100 mistakes in a week and flagged as potential premiums users and see calls to action. If no data was tracked, the user receives a <a href="/resources/retention-email-inspiration">retention email</a> instead.</p>
<p>In the rest of this post, we&rsquo;ll look at how a few businesses are using recurring, automated, personalized emails to extend their product into the inbox.</p>
<h2>Quora: The Daily Email Product</h2>
<p>Wren Lanier, the design and UX lead from Highrise, <a href="http://wrenlanier.com/writing/why-i-love-the-quora-weekly-digest/" target="_blank">sums up the Quora daily newsletter perfectly</a>: &ldquo;In a perfect world, all the emails I receive would be this interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Quora newsletter, which is delivered to all users each morning, didn&rsquo;t become great by accident. Co-founder and CEO Adam D&rsquo;Angelo <a href="https://gigaom.com/2013/01/07/my-conversation-with-ex-facebook-cto-and-quora-co-founder-adam-dangelo/" target="_blank">told GigaOM</a> that they removed serendipity from the equation by writing an algorithm to collect and deliver the best content.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to make something that people would read. What I didn&rsquo;t want was something that was an annoying little email. It took awhile, but it has paid off. We had two people who worked on it (in a dedicated fashion) for a month, though we had been working on-and-off on it for nearly a year and a half. The email essentially looks at what people are reading and engaging (with) the most on Quora.</p></blockquote>
<p>The email is great for many reasons. We&rsquo;ve referenced it on this blog for its <a href="/resources/social-proof" target="_blank">use of social proof</a>, <a href="/resources/guides/email-marketing-best-practices/" target="_blank">interesting subject lines,</a> and <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/promotional-emails/" target="_blank">user-generated content</a>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6979" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/recurring-emails/quora-newsletter/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-newsletter.jpg?fit=822%2C839&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="822,839" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="quora newsletter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-newsletter.jpg?fit=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-newsletter.jpg?fit=822%2C839&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6979" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-newsletter.jpg" alt="quora newsletter" width="822" height="839" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-newsletter.jpg?w=822&amp;ssl=1 822w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/quora-newsletter.jpg?resize=294%2C300&amp;ssl=1 294w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p>
<p>Those are great ways to engage readers, but the foundation of this hugely successful email product is data. Quora relies on an algorithm to identify the most interesting content based on each users&rsquo; interests and behavior. The algorithm even pulls the best answers and images to entice readers to click. No two users receive the same email.</p>
<p>For most Quora users, this is the product. They don&rsquo;t check the site every day, but they do open the email digest and read trending questions and answers. The algorithm ensures that the newsletter is always interesting and that Quora doesn&rsquo;t have to manually curate an email every day. Personalized, data-driven and interesting-exactly the way email should be.</p>
<h2>Mint: A Monthly Snapshot</h2>
<p>Just like Grammarly, Mint uses a recurring email report as a retention/engagement hybrid. Mint pulls data from your account to provide an overview of your spending and investments.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6980" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/recurring-emails/mint_com_email/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint_com_email.jpg?fit=822%2C688&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="822,688" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mint_com_email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint_com_email.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint_com_email.jpg?fit=822%2C688&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6980" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint_com_email.jpg" alt="mint_com_email" width="822" height="688" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint_com_email.jpg?w=822&amp;ssl=1 822w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint_com_email.jpg?resize=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></p>
<p>Nearly all product companies have data that can be shaped into a report. Condensing it into a short, recurring email is the easiest way for users to actually understand it. Sending it on a regular basis promotes the habit of checking in with your product. Done well, great recurring emails can be a valuable selling point for your business.</p>
<p>Mint&rsquo;s emails are comprehensive. Users love the product because it helps them keep track of their finances and identify where they can save money. It tells a story that users can relate to.</p>

<p>Quora can send emails every day, but Mint can&rsquo;t. It wouldn&rsquo;t add value to the user experience. Sending these emails once per month gives users the best perspective on their money. It adds value to Mint&rsquo;s product but doesn&rsquo;t replace the web or mobile apps.</p>
<p>The strategy also gives Mint breathing room to send other emails. They send a mix of product updates, content and retention emails like the one below.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6982" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/recurring-emails/mint-retention-email-3/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint-retention-email.jpg?fit=820%2C651&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="820,651" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="mint retention email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint-retention-email.jpg?fit=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint-retention-email.jpg?fit=820%2C651&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6982" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint-retention-email.jpg" alt="mint retention email" width="820" height="651" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint-retention-email.jpg?w=820&amp;ssl=1 820w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mint-retention-email.jpg?resize=300%2C238&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px"></p>
<p><a href="http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/2014/12/marketers-are-from-mars-consumers-are.html" target="_blank">Marketers tend to overstate their own importance.</a> Mint keeps things in perspective by sending only a handful of useful, personalized emails each month.</p>
<h2>Positionly: Email as a Product Feature</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://positionly.com/" target="_blank">Positionly</a>, email is part of the product offering. Customers can request reports to be generated on a recurring basis and delivered by email.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6983" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/recurring-emails/positionly/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly.png?fit=920%2C217&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="920,217" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="positionly" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly.png?fit=300%2C71&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly.png?fit=920%2C217&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6983" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly.png" alt="positionly" width="920" height="217" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly.png?w=920&amp;ssl=1 920w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly.png?resize=300%2C71&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px"></p>
<p>Positionly runs the reports as requested, exports the data into a PDF and CSV, and attaches the files to an email<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They don&rsquo;t beg users to opt into emails. Instead, they make an email so valuable that their customers want them.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6984" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/recurring-emails/positionly-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly-email.jpg?fit=828%2C609&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="828,609" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="positionly email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly-email.jpg?fit=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly-email.jpg?fit=828%2C609&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6984" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly-email.jpg" alt="positionly email" width="828" height="609" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly-email.jpg?w=828&amp;ssl=1 828w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/positionly-email.jpg?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px"></p>
<p>This email may seem understated. What exactly is so special about it?</p>
<p>Positionly is thinking bigger about email. Their emails are a useful extension of the product. Do they serve as an engagement and retention tool as well? Sure. But the premise of these messages is focused squarely on utility.</p>
<p>As Y Combinator president <a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/" target="_blank">Sam Altman says</a>, &ldquo;Your job is to build something that users love.&rdquo; That means a great experience on the web, mobile devices, <em>and</em> the inbox.</p>
<h2>Recurring Email Best Practices</h2>
<p>At Vero, we&rsquo;ve just released the ability to create recurring newsletters that are sent on a daily, weekly or monthly schedule. You can enable these in our <em>Vero Labs</em> area (if you sign up for a trial you can access this too).</p>
<p>In releasing this feature, we&rsquo;ve talked to our customers and thought a lot about the sorts of campaigns we want to help our customers create. Here are a few best practices for implementing behavioral emails.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Treat email like a part of your product, not a marketing channel.</strong> This mindset change affects everything from subject lines and body copy to functionality and utility.</li>
<li><strong>Start with low-hanging fruit.</strong> Usage reports and digests are good places to start since they require your product and marketing teams to collaborate. This will require ensuring you track user properties or pull in data from an external API or web feed (which is why we built our <a href="veropublic.wpengine.com/external-attributes" target="_blank">External Attributes</a> feature). This process will mean engineers and marketers working together, which helps ensure your emails are tightly aligned with your product strategy. It proves that you insist on a great experience for your users.</li>
<li><strong>Explore cutting-edge technology.</strong> Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool to <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/how-to-code-a-live-dynamic-twitter-feed-in-html-email" target="_blank">build a live Twitter stream into a conference email</a>? Or take advantage of structured data to <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/markup/" target="_blank">integrate your emails with other apps</a>? Or even <a href="http://www.emailmonks.com/blog/email-marketing/interactive-email-introducing-accordion-in-emails/" target="_blank">create interactive menus for mobile emails</a>? Get your team excited about trying something new and pushing the boundaries.</li>
</ol><p>There are a huge array of things you can implement with recurring newsletters. We&rsquo;re excited to start helping companies do more.</p>
<h2>More Recurring Email Inspiration</h2>
<p>To round out this post, I wanted to share some more inspiration. Here are a few other companies sending great personalized, recurring emails.</p>

<p>For some businesses, that&rsquo;s a rhetorical question. It&rsquo;s pointless to differentiate when user experience is the sole focus.</p>
<p>The inbox is a perfect example. Email has become synonymous with noise and indifference. A few companies have opted out of the email runaround by approaching the inbox as an extension of their product.</p>
<p>Users gravitate towards utility wherever it exists. Email can deliver functionality and earn habitual engagement. It&rsquo;s as important to product development as web, desktop, and mobile.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/grammar-check" target="_blank">Grammarly</a>, today&rsquo;s case study subject, understands exactly how to execute on this. Their emails check all the boxes of a great product: useful, accessible, interesting and personalized. The inbox is no longer for marketing, it&rsquo;s for experience.</p>

<p>Millions of people rely on Grammarly to check their emails, social media updates and documents for grammatical errors.</p>
<p>On the surface, Grammarly is a simple browser extension. What most users don&rsquo;t know is that it&rsquo;s actually a carefully crafted product, supported by a growing team engineers, linguists and data scientists. Grammar is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MrDrewPrice" target="_blank">Drew Price</a>, Grammarly&rsquo;s head of product marketing, sees the product as part of the quantified self movement. Fitbit tracks your steps, Grammarly tracks your words. In each case, the goal is the same: track the data, identify trends and find ways to improve.</p>
<p>Whether you call yourself a writer or not, you spend plenty of time writing emails, updating social media sites, sending client-facing emails or drafting proposals.</p>
<p>The written word is a fundamental skill for all knowledge workers. Grammarly aims to make progress an enjoyable experience. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s genuinely fun, for the first time, to have insights on your writing habits,&rdquo; says Price.</p>
<h2>Building a Product Lifecycle from the Ground Up</h2>
<p>The market is right for self-tracking. At least 69 percent of Americans are already tracking a health indicator according to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/01/28/tracking-for-health/">Pew Internet</a>. As that market grows, more people are turning to technology for help collecting data. All evidence indicates that health tracking is just the beginning.</p>
<p>That said, turning a tedious task like writing into a lifestyle is a real challenge. To do it, Price and the team at Grammarly are tapping into the core principles of a stickiness: gamification, community, and a first-class experience.</p>
<p>Because they track writing on multiple devices and platforms, email has become a central element to the Grammarly product. In fact, all of the data points &ndash; words written, errors made, and vocabulary used &ndash; are delivered in a concise weekly email.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weekly reports product is meant to be our bread and butter from an email perspective,&rdquo; says Price. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a retention/engagement hybrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This email is sent to every Grammarly user, every Monday. It&rsquo;s not meant to drive conversions &ndash; the email digest is an actual product feature.</p>
<h2>How to Tell a Story with Data</h2>
<p>Numbers can tell a story. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons self-tracking has caught on. Increasing your daily step count can trigger weight loss and improved energy. Expanding your vocabulary and making fewer mistakes leads to better writing.</p>
<p>Grammarly adds context to the data they collect. They, for example, compare your data to other users. This fosters a sense of community and serves as social proof for new users.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="548px"><img data-attachment-id="6955" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-mistakes-made/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?fit=548%2C303&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="548,303" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly mistakes made" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?fit=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?fit=548%2C303&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6955" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png" alt="grammarly mistakes made" width="548" height="303" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?w=548&amp;ssl=1 548w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-mistakes-made.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>They pair hard numbers with targeted content. By dynamically inserting content based on activity, Grammarly provides a logical next step for users seeking to improve. If they notice you tend to forget commas, you&rsquo;ll see content based on that topic.</p>

<h2>Segmenting the Product for a Better Experience</h2>
<p>There are three versions of the weekly progress email. The one above is sent to users who tracked more than 100 words in the last week. Another is sent to users who tracked between one and 99 words. This group has obviously tested the product and needs either encouragement or technical support.<br>
A third version is sent to users who didn&rsquo;t track any words. They address common reasons for churn and use a strong call to action to draw users back into the fold.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6957" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/2-grammarly-email/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=753%2C732&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="753,732" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly-inactivity" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=753%2C732&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg" alt="grammarly-inactivity" width="753" height="732" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2-grammarly-email1.jpg?resize=300%2C292&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px"></p>
<p>Within these segments are more segments. Grammarly breaks out active users with more than 100 mistakes in the last week for advanced targeting. These users stand to benefit from the premium product, so they see different copy and calls to action.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="504px"><img data-attachment-id="6958" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?fit=504%2C282&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="504,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly-upgrade-to-premium" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?fit=504%2C282&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6958" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg" alt="grammarly-upgrade-to-premium" width="504" height="282" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?w=504&amp;ssl=1 504w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-upgrade-to-premium1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px"></p>
<p>In addition to the weekly report, Grammarly uses <a href="/resources/saas-onboarding-emails/" target="_blank">email to onboard new users</a>, promote the premium product and update blog readers. To avoid overlap with autoresponders and behavioral campaigns, they always send the weekly report on Monday. Engagement and retention campaigns are always prioritized above promotional email. This can mean heavy segmenting, but it&rsquo;s worth the effort to keep happy users engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing I want to do is frustrate people who use and love the product,&rdquo; says Price.</p>
<h2>Email as Product, Experience as Marketing</h2>
<p>With all the attention to detail in the reports, you might expect that Grammarly&rsquo;s other emails are equally exceptional. You&rsquo;d be right.</p>
<p>Most users discover Grammarly browser extension first, so the team has mapped most of the campaigns around that organic journey.</p>
<p>They also offer a text editor, but Price and his team have found that the extension is the stickiest product. You&rsquo;ll notice an emphasis on the extension in the emails. Retention is key. If users love the extension, they are much more likely to explore the text editor and eventually upgrade.</p>
<p>As a result of the product layers, Grammarly has created <a href="/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle campaigns</a> to match the different ways users discover and use the products. Price is quick to emphasize that &ldquo;there is no one-size-fits-all approach.&rdquo; Each campaign is created with a single goal in mind, based on the attributes of the target users.</p>
<p>Take their <a href="/resources/welcome-emails/">welcome email</a> for example. Users who initially register for the browser extension receive a different email than those who sign up only for the text editor.</p>
<p>(Here&rsquo;s the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3-grammarly-extension.jpg" target="_blank">welcome email for browser extension users</a>. And here&rsquo;s the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4-grammarly-text-editor.jpg" target="_blank">welcome email for text editor users</a>.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6970" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/grammarly-welcome-emails/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-welcome-emails.jpg?fit=702%2C450&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="702,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="grammarly welcome emails" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-welcome-emails.jpg?fit=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-welcome-emails.jpg?fit=702%2C450&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6970" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-welcome-emails.jpg" alt="grammarly welcome emails" width="702" height="450" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-welcome-emails.jpg?w=702&amp;ssl=1 702w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/grammarly-welcome-emails.jpg?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p>Each email is the first in a series that takes users through the respective product. The campaigns are course-correction for users-they either address inactivity or build on momentum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go through our funnel one time and decline the prompt to install the browser extension, we don&rsquo;t send a traditional welcome email,&rdquo; says Price. &ldquo;We focus on encouraging that user to re-think installing our extension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That email (shown below) is general, but the campaign gets more specific if the user doesn&rsquo;t take action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the initial inactivity email, we try to get very specific,&rdquo; says Price. &ldquo;One email is around privacy concerns because we&rsquo;ve done surveys and know that some people worry about what we&rsquo;re doing with their data. Another focuses on extra features, like <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/words/">our thesaurus</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6961" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/5-grammarly-email/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=753%2C1873&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="753,1873" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="5-grammarly-email" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=121%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg?fit=412%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6961" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg" alt="5-grammarly-email" width="753" height="1873" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg?w=753&amp;ssl=1 753w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg?resize=121%2C300&amp;ssl=1 121w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5-grammarly-email1.jpg?resize=412%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 412w" sizes="(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px"></p>
<p>Technical issues can also be a challenge for new users. They must, for example, be logged-in to track their writing over time. The longer inactivity persists, the more Grammarly digs into the roadblocks. It is paramount that users overcome this initial hurdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting that first product install is the main KPI for the abandoned install stream. It&rsquo;s not about converting you to premium, it&rsquo;s about just getting you to install and use our product for the first time. That&rsquo;s the main goal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These emails are successful because Grammarly finds the right moment, not time, to send them. But they also employ some sophisticated copywriting and design that leaves the user feeling unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Zeigarnik_Effect" target="_blank">Zeigarnik Effect</a> &ndash; &ldquo;the tendency to experience intrusive thoughts about an objective that was once pursued and left incomplete&rdquo; &ndash; is no gimmick. It&rsquo;s a tried-and-true gamification strategy with plenty of science to support its efficacy.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works in marketing and product design: Progress bars show users there is more work to do. That creates a tension that users can only relieve by completing the task.</p>

<p>Grammarly uses copy and images to reward users for their progress and remind them that their work isn&rsquo;t finished. The result is a nagging feeling of incompleteness. Upgrading is the only way to satisfy the feeling.</p>
<h2>Building Relationships and Trust with Email</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Think long-term. Think of creating an optimal relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those are Drew Price&rsquo;s words of advice for email marketers. It&rsquo;s easy to say and hard to execute.</p>
<p>In general, Grammarly&rsquo;s emails are interesting and personalized. But there is one email that really speaks to how seriously Grammarly takes Price&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6966" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/grammarly/7-grammarly-newsletter/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?fit=766%2C1041&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="766,1041" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="7-grammarly-newsletter" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?fit=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?fit=753%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6966" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg" alt="7-grammarly-newsletter" width="766" height="1041" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?w=766&amp;ssl=1 766w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?resize=221%2C300&amp;ssl=1 221w, https://i0.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7-grammarly-newsletter1.jpg?resize=753%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 753w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px"></p>
<p>Instead of adding every new user to the newsletter list &ndash; a common, albeit frustrating, practice &ndash; they ask users if they&rsquo;d like to receive updates from the company blog.</p>
<p>This is subtle but important. If Grammarly added new users to the newsletter by default, they&rsquo;d water down their own product by adding noise to the inbox. The opt-in request provides a cleaner experience and fosters a trusting relationship in the process.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing easy about putting together exceptional email campaigns. The initial creation process required contributions from six people, including two designers, a handful of developers and the company&rsquo;s co-founder. A team of three handles the maintenance and testing of the existing campaigns. As Price says, &ldquo;creating a great customer experience is never done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many one-size-fits-all best practices. It&rsquo;s about figuring out the relationship you want to have with your customers, then working backward. Be surgical.&rdquo;</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>People are afraid of your product and it could be the primary reason you aren&rsquo;t getting as many signups as you want.</p>
<p>Humans are lizards. They fear the unknown. Even if your target market understands that your product could solve a real problem, they are afraid it won&rsquo;t work. Or that it will be a hassle. Or even that it&rsquo;s too big of a commitment. The reasons are endless, but there is a solution to calming consumer anxiety.</p>
<p>The brilliant <a href="https://twitter.com/copyhackers" target="_blank">Joanna Wiebe</a> uses conversion buttons to illustrate the this problem. Buttons are doors. You wouldn&rsquo;t open a door unless you knew what was behind it, right? I hope not. So why would you expect people that visit your site to click buttons that don&rsquo;t explain what is going to happen next?</p>

<p>Expand this thinking into the rest of your marketing. If your visitors and leads can&rsquo;t see, touch and feel your product, expect them to have anxiety about signing up.</p>
<h2>What Causes Consumer Anxiety?</h2>
<p>Consumer anxiety is the baseline. If you work in marketing, this is your starting point. Your potential customers are skeptical of you, your product and your claim that it will make their life easier.</p>
<p>Here are just a few things that cause consumer anxiety:</p>
<ul><li>Fear of the unknown</li>
<li>Fear of being duped (also known as <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/11/343_124378.html" target="_blank">Sugrophobia</a>)</li>
<li>Lack of clarity</li>
<li>Not enough context</li>
<li>A poor value proposition</li>
<li>Bad reviews</li>
<li>Overwhelming amounts of information</li>
</ul><p><strong>The key to solving almost all anxiety is clarity.</strong> If people know what to expect, they are more likely to kick the tires and ultimately become a customer.</p>
<h2>Unboxing: A Cure for Uncertainty</h2>
<p>In recent years, there&rsquo;s been a sharp increase in &ldquo;unboxing&rdquo; videos. These videos are simple and literal &ndash; the viewer watches someone open a new product and describe the hands-on experience.</p>
<p>A quick search on YouTube reveals more than 19 million results for the term. Google <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/youtube-insights-stats-data-trends-vol7.html" target="_blank">reported</a> in November 2014 that, &ldquo;Unboxing video views have grown 57% over the past year, and uploads have grown more than 50%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even more interesting: <strong>One of five consumers has watched an unboxing video on YouTube.</strong></p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&amp;q=unboxing&amp;tz=Etc/GMT%2B4&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=627"></script></p>
<p>What can we make of this phenomenon?</p>
<p>Tess Barker, a comedian and writer, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2135510/product-unboxing-videos-psychology/" target="_blank">compared the addictive nature of unboxing videos to porn</a>. While that reference may be tongue-in-cheek, she also explains the psychology of <em>why</em> humans crave this type of stimulation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do we get such pleasure from watching someone else do something?</p></blockquote>
<p>Our brains seem to be hardwired that way. We&rsquo;re equipped with something called &ldquo;mirror neurons,&rdquo; which, explains [psychologist Dr. Judy] White, &ldquo;are the same neurons that fire when we watch an activity that are fired when we perform that same activity ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, if the person doing an activity is &ldquo;enough like you that you can identify with him &hellip; and is experiencing this excitement of unwrapping this product,&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll feel it &ldquo;can happen to you too.&rdquo; And, incredibly, &ldquo;The same neurons would be firing if you were to unwrap it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How incredible is that?</p>
<p>Showing a potential customer what a product looks and feels like actually triggers a neurological response. This explains the flood of unboxing videos but it should also be a light bulb moment for marketers. This is a strategy that be replicated in other areas as well. Namely, email marketing.</p>
<h2>The Unboxing Technique in Email Marketing</h2>
<p>Showing your product to potential customers is one of the easiest ways to <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/education-to-activation/">bridge the gap between education and activation</a>. The strategy can be used in newsletters, <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/product-update-emails">product update emails</a>, <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/evernote-onboarding">onboarding emails</a> and <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/guides/lifecycle-marketing/">lifecycle emails</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the unboxing technique pulled from my own inbox, along with suggestions to make yours shine.</p>
<h3>Dollar Shave Club: A Literal Unboxing</h3>
<p>This is the most literal interpretation of the unboxing strategy that I could find. Dollar Shave Club actually includes a photo of an open box along with the products you can expect when you sign up.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/retention-email-inspiration">retention email</a> sent to someone who starts the checkout process but abandons it before paying.</p>
<p>When Dollar Shave Club asks themselves, &ldquo;What scared them away?&rdquo; they clearly believe that <strong>fear of the unknown</strong> is high on the list. A <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/232285/reasons-for-online-shopping-cart-abandonment/" target="_blank">Statista study</a> found that &ldquo;decided against buying&rdquo; is the fifth most common reason that people abandon carts. In most other cases, they <em>wanted</em> the product but were scared away by something else.</p>
<p>This is a great example of easing anxiety with the simplest of methods: clarity.</p>

<h3>Coursera: Putting a Face on the Product</h3>
<p>Online education is a bit of an abstract concept. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy enough to understand that it&rsquo;s like a classroom on the Internet, but what exactly does it look like? Who are the instructors? What can I expect to learn?</p>
<p>Coursera makes an effort to answers these questions and provide clarity for new students by showing them <em>who</em> is teaching their upcoming classes. There is so much context in this email. Not only can you see the instructors&rsquo; faces, you get a bit of information on their background, what their classes cover and when the classes start.</p>
<p>Also of note, this email is triggered to inactive students and the suggested classes are based on the interests those students indicated in the onboarding process.</p>

<h3>Twitter: Visualizing the Future</h3>
<p>No Twitter user will ever become active if they don&rsquo;t connect with people. Following other users and having people follow you is the key to making the entire platform work.</p>
<p>That means it&rsquo;s <em>extremely</em> important to get new users up and running quickly. Completing a profile is one step in that direction and Twitter sends a series of emails like this one to ensure that happens.</p>
<p>Notice that his email, which uses the <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/resources/1-2-3-method/">1-2-3 method</a> to match each task with a visual aid. It helps the new user understand why they should bother taking the steps and reduces the friction involved in the process.</p>
<p>Because the&Acirc;&nbsp;user can visualize their own profile before taking this action, it&rsquo;s much more likely they will actually complete it.</p>

<h3>Elevate: A Visual Product Update</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to visualize a software product without using it.</p>
<p>This is why solving the users&rsquo; problem isn&rsquo;t always enough. They need to be comfortable with your software in order to actually use it.</p>
<p>Elevate includes screenshots in nearly every email they send. They wisely frame the images on mobile phones since this is where users will actually interact with the software.</p>
<p>Just one email, like the one below, gives you a good sense of what to expect when you use Elevate. Now, imagine the cumulative effect of unboxing new features in every email. It&rsquo;s profoundly different than simply explaining how the app works.</p>

<h3>Gumroad: Unboxing with GIFs</h3>
<p>If an animation is needed to provide clarity and reduce anxiety, use GIFs.</p>
<p>GIFs work well in emails because, unlike videos, they are friendly in most email clients and play automatically.</p>
<p>Gumroad announced PayPal integration, then immediately shows what it looks like. Users don&rsquo;t have to wonder if it&rsquo;s useful or how it will work, they can just absorb this simple animation. It&rsquo;s unboxing at it&rsquo;s finest.</p>
