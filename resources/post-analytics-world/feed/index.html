		<description><![CDATA[I hear what you are saying, but putting conversions before readership is not a long term strategy.


This is by no means an easy nut to crack. A lot of sites abuse overlays because it&#039;s really hard to convert readers into subscribers and ultimately customers. We&#039;ll be touching on this subject again soon as we are making some changes to the way we run our blog. (Fewer posts but way more in-depth and fewer calls to action.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this concept of micro-wins. But I&#039;m not sure if I agree with your stance on overlays....for me, doubling e-mail opt-ins is worth any &quot;annoyance&quot; experienced by readers. On top of that, readers who are not motivated enough to close the overlay or opt-in to the offer are, frankly, not part of the audience I&#039;m trying to reach. 


Unfortunately, the way overlays are used and implemented often leave much to be desired (the ones posted on tab closed are great examples of what NOT to do.) If Vero had  a way to inject an overlay similar to the way you guy&#039;s trigger an e-mail would be awesome! (i.e. the third session a visitor visits the blog, only then does the overlay pop up) 


Final thought: if your e-mail auto-responder sequence is good enough (and segmented accurately enough) it shouldn&#039;t matter where/ how you get the e-mails.]]></description>
