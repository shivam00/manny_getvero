		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris, this is indeed a good post. I must commend Emil for the format he has presented including your detailed explanation. Why more companies don&#039;t deliver a personalised upgrade email is beyond me, instead they choose to shove it down your throat as you explained. But at the end of the day, which one encourages each individual to upgrade is down to their own personal taste and vision. Thanks for sharing.]]></description>
