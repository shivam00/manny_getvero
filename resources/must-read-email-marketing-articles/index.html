<html><body><p>A few months ago, we started a weekly roundup of curated stories called The Whitelist. It wasn&rsquo;t a hit, so we&rsquo;re pivoting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a good opportunity to examine the content we create. It&rsquo;s also a very transparent marketing lesson. We had an idea, it didn&rsquo;t work and now we are re-purposing the content for something else. Below, you&rsquo;ll find all of the stories we included the roundups &hellip; more than 50 of them. I hesitate to call it a failure since we learned a few important lessons about what Vero readers want. With one less article to write each week, we now have more time to create the content we know you guys love.</p>
<p>These articles mostly focus on email marketing, conversion optimization, copywriting, content and social media. There are a few off-topic articles but everything here is relevant and valuable to any email marketer.</p>
<p>As we find new must-reads, we&rsquo;ll add them here so you may want to bookmark this page.</p>
<p><span id="more-3554"></span></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/failed-ab-tests" target="_blank">6 A/B Tests That Did Absolutely Nothing for Us</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to love Alex Turnbull&rsquo;s candid stories on all-things startups. Failure can be difficult thing to write about but Alex pulls it off beautifully in this post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing blog posts nearly every day about how a company doubled, tripled, or quadrupled their results with the simple flick of a switch &ndash; even on this very blog &ndash; can make it easy to believe that such a button exists.</p>
<p>But one of the hardest lessons that I&rsquo;ve had to learn as an entrepreneur is that, try as I might, I can&rsquo;t find that button.</p>
<p>And I likely never will.</p>
<p>What we don&rsquo;t see when we look at those &ldquo;big win&rdquo; case studies is the hundreds (sometimes thousands) of tests that had to completely flop before success happened &ldquo;with a simple test.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/business/media/for-email-a-death-greatly-exaggerated.html" target="_blank">For Email Newsletters, a Death Greatly Exaggerated</a></strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see a well-regarded publication like the <em>New York Times</em> cover our industry. The more crowded social networks like Twitter and Facebook get, the article reports, the more valuable curated email newsletters become.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Email is dismissed as something old people use,&rdquo; said Gideon Lichfield, global news editor at Quartz. &ldquo;But in the past few years, we have started to see email as a peer to publishing platforms like Twitter, Facebook and the web, one that has its own strengths and weaknesses that we are starting to figure out.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://conversionxl.com/creating-customer-personas-using-data-driven-research/?hvid=2AD8ar" target="_blank">How To Create Customer Personas With Actual, Real Life Data</a></strong></p>
<p>Your business will never reach its potential if you don&rsquo;t understand who your customers are and what makes them tick. A great post from Jennifer Havice on the ConversionXL blog.</p>
<blockquote><p>When was the last time you took a long hard look at what makes your customer base tick?</p>
<p>Think customer personas &ndash; those detailed representations of the different segments of your target audience. Fueled by data driven research that map out the who behind the buying decisions of your products or services, customer personas can help inform everything from more effective copy to product development.</p>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been awhile&rdquo; or &ldquo;never,&rdquo; you need to keep reading.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/02/27-marketing-tips-thatll-woo-your-visitors-and-win-them-over/" target="_blank">27 Marketing Tips That&rsquo;ll Woo Your Visitors and Win Them Over</a></strong></p>
<p>Some great reminders from Neil Patel. If you&rsquo;re frustrated with your marketing, get back to basics with these tips.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Blog to help, not to sell</strong> &ndash; most people blog to gain visitors and to convert them into customers. People are smart, and they&rsquo;ll see right through that. Blog to help educate your visitors. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll want to give you money without you even asking for it.

<blockquote><p>The Help Scout blog has had a rockin&rsquo; first year, and in a paltry 12 months we&rsquo;ve managed to build up a newsletter of 30,000 subscribers, when tens of thousands of visitors per month (over 100,000 last month).</p>

<p>Popup ads are often reviled by readers but the simple truth is that they are very effective. We&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/content-cannibalization/">content cannibalization</a> on this blog before but in this post on the ConversionXL blog, Ott Niggulis explores the line between converting and annoying readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether you personally love it or hate it, the truth is, sticking a big ole pop-up in their face can be one of the most effective ways to jolt their attention &amp; grab their email for a return visit.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s related to a persuasion technique known as the &ldquo;pattern interrupt,&rdquo; which is basically when something unexpected happens after the brain has become lulled into a rhythm. You&rsquo;ll experience this frequently in negotiations, while watching movies &amp; when watching comedians.</p>
<p>In the context of email &amp; content marketing though, it&rsquo;s particularly effective when the &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; proposes to solve the problem that the the reader has been tuned into, or programmed to expect given the nature of the service.</p></blockquote>

Apple uses landing pages not only to sell products but to build hype. This great post by Will Hoekenga on LeadPages explores exactly how Apple approaches landing pages.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when you have top-notch products, hundreds of millions of customers, and great design, you can still use copywriting to give yourself an advantage over your competition.</p>

<p>There is some seriously valuable advice in this article for brands looking to engage with customers not just on social media, but anywhere. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And people on the network are okay with being approached by brands?</strong></p>
<p>The weird thing is that as an industry we&rsquo;ve got this mindset of, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ve got to make something viral. You have to be cute and clever and you have to add cats and make it likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Reddit it&rsquo;s almost a throwback, where yes, really good content is really good content, but that&rsquo;s not really interesting to people. If you have a product, people want to talk shop. They want to ask questions about it, they want a human response from someone about why various choices were made about the product or distribution or things like that. It can be a very focused or product-driven conversation.</p>
<p>For some reason online marketing has moved away from that. And I think that speaks back to the findings of the report, that <strong>people want human and they want innovation</strong> &ndash; they want to talk nuts and bolts sometimes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Despite the widespread lack of trust most consumers are still willing to share copious amounts of personal information under the right circumstances.

<blockquote><p>The consumer has never had a louder voice. With tools like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and Google Reviews, one unpleasant experience with a business can be shared with thousands of people. This is great for both consumers and businesses. Consumers can research companies and previous customer experiences with a business before they purchase, and businesses that create great customer experiences are more likely to succeed.

<p>Longform content has to be really, really good in order to keep our attention, and The Daily Egg does it right. This 1,500-word post, which is the fifth in a five part series, covers testing landing pages from top to bottom.</p>
<blockquote><p>To optimize anything, you need to conduct a scientific experiment, carefully analyze the results, select the optimal result, and repeat. If everything is done correctly, the results get better and better over time.</p>
<p>This concept applies very nicely to website design.</p>
<p>A good website design is one that delivers consistently high conversion rates. But even the best websites can increase conversions. You simply need to know how.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> website is so massive that it&rsquo;s traffic can be representative of global web trends. In addition to social media, email is one of the main reasons that home pages receive less traffic than ever. Rather than going looking for news and content, people get it delivered to them. Just one more reason to spend extra time developing <a href="http://blog.getvero.com/email-marketing-increase-revenue-34-percent/" target="_blank">strategic email newsletters</a>.</p>

<p>This post is more than a year old but after hearing Joanna speak at the Authority conference, I felt it was important to share. She breaks down which words are great for conversion and which words should be avoided at all costs. It&rsquo;s a great read.</p>
<blockquote><p>Friction words are words that describe things people <em>have</em> to do &ndash; not things people <em>want</em> to do. They cause cognitive friction. Web copy that converts is focused on what people <em>want</em> to do.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>32. <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64822-can-win-back-email-campaigns-help-reactivate-lapsed-customers">Can win-back email campaigns help reactivate lapsed customers?</a></strong></p>
<p>This post provides a pretty interesting look at &ldquo;win-back&rdquo; email campaigns. It&rsquo;s a good read overall but I pulled one <em>very</em> important tip from it: <strong>Clean your email lists</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Major mailbox providers such as Gmail and Outlook commonly use engagement metrics to decide whether or not a particular sender should be considered as a spammer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a former user hasn&rsquo;t logged into their mailbox for an extended period of time then providers sometimes turn them into &lsquo;spam traps&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If marketers consistently send messages to spam traps then it&rsquo;s a sign they aren&rsquo;t cleaning their email list, which is another warning signal that they might be a spammer.</p>
<p>In order to avoid being incorrectly labelled as an evil spammer, marketers should consider using win-back email campaigns on lapsed subscribers before ultimately scratching them from their database for good.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tommy Walker from ConversionXL has a way of articulating complex growth strategies in a way that anyone can understand.

There are plenty of examples and action items &acirc;&#128;&brvbar; don&rsquo;t miss this one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just so I&rsquo;m clear, when I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Email Onboarding&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not talking about newsletters or batch &amp; blast messaging that asks me to read your latest blog post.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m talking about is creating a narrative in the inbox that &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; seamlessly transitions me from &ldquo;lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;customer&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; to &ldquo;evangelist&rdquo; by acknowledging how I interact with the stuff you send me and adjusting itself accordingly, made possible by trigger &amp; behavioral based email rules.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>36. <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/your-next-email-subject-line/" target="_blank">4 Hacks You Should Know Before You Craft Your Next Email Subject Line</a></strong></p>
<p>We love hacks, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that we really liked Zach Bulygo&rsquo;s post on subject line hacks on the KISSmetrics blog. These tips are straightforward, simple and potentially very powerful. Keep this bookmarked for the next time you are struggling with a subject line.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no such thing as the perfect subject line. As a marketer, you need to test your subject lines and see which ones get the most opens. (Now, clearly, getting people to open your email is only one part. After that you need to get them to click or tap on something in the email.) But you&rsquo;ve won half the battle if you can get them to open the email.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>37. <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/what-is-spam.html" target="_blank">What is spam?</a></strong></p>
<p>Seth Godin, the father of permission marketing, offers a philosophical explanation of spam. In short, spam destroys trust. Read on to see how to earn trust and keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam is in the eye of the beholder, and so my definition of permission marketing kicks in: If the person you&rsquo;re communicating with would have missed you if you didn&rsquo;t show up, you have permission. On the other hand, just because you know someone&rsquo;s email address or phone number, just because you have figured out how to automate a captcha or hack a discussion board doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re welcome there.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had never heard of the Weigel distribution but it&rsquo;s application to content marketing is spot on. Basically, the longer a visitor stays on your site, the less likely they are to leave. The principle is simple but getting those visitors interested in the first place isn&rsquo;t easy. Nate Munger breaks it down with plenty of examples and tips.</p>
<p class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/how-long-stay.png" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<blockquote><p>It just so happens 99% of websites follow a negative Weibel distribution; the longer a person stays on a site, the less likely they are to leave.</p>
<p>The steep portion of this graph is that first 10 to 20 seconds a visitor uses to decide if a website is worth their time. If you can get them past that initial quick, harsh judgment, your chances of keeping them for much longer increase dramatically. That&rsquo;s the flat part of the Weibel curve.</p>
<p>If you can keep them for 30 seconds, you&rsquo;re almost as likely to keep them for 2 minutes or more.</p></blockquote>
