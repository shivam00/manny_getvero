		<description><![CDATA[Great post Chris!

Draft is the cleanest way to create simple HTMLs. I am still trying to find some HTML editor that would permit a newcomer to work with tables, cells, styles, etc.

Litmus is another must have, so much so that we are trying to integrate our own plaform with theirs.

We have a cool tool here, altough is in portuguese, it helps our clients to work better with big images: www.fatiaimagem.com.br]]></description>
