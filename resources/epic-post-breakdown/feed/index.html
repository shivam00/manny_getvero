		<description><![CDATA[Nice one Jimmy! Good to see the Skyscraper Technique working out for you.


I know how much time it takes to do that outreach, manage responses, etc. But that&#039;s what makes it worth it when you get those kinds of results.


Would love some social icons at the end of your posts, so I don&#039;t have to scroll alllllllll the way up to the top to share your stuff.


;)


Keep up the good work man.]]></description>
