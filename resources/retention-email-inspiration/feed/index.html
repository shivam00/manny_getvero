		<description><![CDATA[HI Jimmy-

The following is the formula for calculating Customer Retention Rate = ((CE-CN)/CS)) X 100

CE = number of customers at end of period

CN = number of new customers acquired during period

CS = number of customers at start of period

Question: How do i factor into the above formula some probability of customers re-ordering.

Key Hurdle is that i am doing forecasting into future and cannot identify the name or location or get demographic detail of my business customer. So i cannot quantify the exact no of customers who re-order. All of these customers who re-order will have a decreasing probability of re-ordering in future.

Assume some (any) probability which will help predict that some percentage of customers from the new customers being keep reordering. And slowly decrease the probability for the same individual in future so as to notify that his future purchase intent is lower than the recent past.

The following are the inputs

-A(n) = New Customers who keep coming in every month. When they come in they buy once.

-B(n) = Existing customers who keep reordering. under this there are three splits - customers who order once, twice and thrice in a year.

-B(n)--&#062;a - Existing customers who reorder only once in a year (For any reordering next year or subsequent years they have a lesser probability of ordering)

-B(n)--&#062;b - Existing customers who reorder twice in a year (For any reordering next year or subsequent years they have a lesser probability of ordering)

-B(n)--&#062;c - Existing customers who reorder thrice in a year (For any reordering next year or subsequent years they have a lesser probability of ordering).

If i have to calculate retention rate of customers i have to exactly identify how many customers are there at the end of any period (here it is a YEAR) that were alive (bought something) atleast once, twice and thrice in the period.
