		<description><![CDATA[I hope it works for you bro, seriously I just wanted to help you out, that&#039;s the spirit that I sent it in, nothing more :-) I&#039;m working on a giveaway for my own site right now so that I can re-launch my business.  Had a heart attack (at 41), depression that comes along with it, but thank God, pulling out of it now.  Took 2 years but I&#039;m back to being excited about marketing again!!  I hope an A/Btest works for you :-)  you can get me at: leare -at- totalinfotech.com 

Have a great day and you have done a wonderful job at your site! (I should have probably sent something encouraging first) :-)]]></description>
