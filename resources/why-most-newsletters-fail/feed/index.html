		<description><![CDATA[As someone who has dealt with email marketing as a consumer, and is just barely getting into the world of marketing as a marketer, I love all of the points brought out in this post. Out of the hundreds of emails I get daily, I rarely open all of them. But I do know what emails I will open out of curiosity or routine, and which ones I definitely won&#039;t. Obviously emails that provide insights on discounts and other helpful monetary gain the customer might have are useful, as well as content that I&#039;m thinking about day-to-day. It may be hard to match each individual newsletter to each individual client, but there is definitely a science to it! Figuring out that connection is the best way to reach out to customers whether it&#039;s directly tied to your brand, or content that leads to the use of your brand. Great post! Love it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Understanding the disconnect between what marketers have to say and what consumers is interested is key to a successful marketing strategy, especially when it comes to emails and newsletters. The faulting of viewing email as its own channel is an interesting strategic perspective. If marketers focus on generating quality content and increasing the user experience then they can generate brand equity and awareness, thus creating more loyal customer. One of the most interesting points Daly brings up is email frequency, and I completely agree that having a process whereby the customer and marketer mutually agree or email frequency is likely to reduce unsubscription rates.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the article Jimmy. 

You make some great points. It really is very important of course that the content is relevant to the person receiving the Email. This can be hard to achieve though, meaning that all too often the emails are simply ignored or sent to junk. Get it right though and email campaigns can be very effective indeed so it is worth the effort.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this great article. This make me come up with one question.
Question: Is it a good strategy to send new subscribers an email asking them for example &#039;what are their biggest problem?&#039; or simply start to interact with them?
Thanks]]></description>
