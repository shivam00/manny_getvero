		<description><![CDATA[@emilyveach:disqus Really good question.


We measure newsletter subscribers and free trials using Vero. So when I send a newsletter, I can set a conversion goal (usually &quot;Signed up for trial&quot;) and easily measure how many convert. It&#039;s a little more difficult to track that across platforms and mediums. We use Google Analytics multi-channel attribution but are considering a more advanced analytics tool to supplement that (KISSmetrics, MixPanel, RJMetrics are great options).


Monday&#039;s post will tackle this to a degree - it&#039;s a new way to think about and measure conversions. :)


Hope that helps. Feel free to shoot me an email at jimmy at getvero dot com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like Ikea&#039;s approach. I think the era of folks getting &quot;freaked out&quot; about answering some of those questions in order for them to receive relevant content because they&#039;re personal might be phasing out. A lot of it is conventional thinking (too creepy), which deter some marketers from taking this brilliant approach. Once someone has taken an interest in receiving promotional emails from you, they&#039;ve already shown some trust/interest in what you&#039;re selling so it only makes sense to capitalize on that in their interest. Posing the &quot;why not ask?&quot; question is a clever way to enlighten them a bit. Good post Jimmy!]]></description>
