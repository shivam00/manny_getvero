		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great content/article! Question for the community/moderator/writer: the article clearly says to not oversell in the email and you will get a higher number of clicks to your landing page, etc. However, I&#039;m curious what that does to the overall conversion metrics... For example, by softening the language and getting a higher CTA from the email to the landing page, does that also yield a higher level of conversions in the end? Or, does a more &quot;aggressive&quot; CTA deliver more qualified leads and thus conversions? I would be curious if anyone has any data on this... happy to clarify further if needed as well!]]></description>
