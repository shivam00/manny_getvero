<html><body><p>Using dynamic content you can personalize your email and push notifications to create more relevant and engaging customer experiences. With Vero, you can use the Liquid templating language, and it&rsquo;s full support for dynamic content to personalize your messages.</p>
<p>Liquid offers a huge amount of flexibility to customize the data you already send to Vero, and it often saves you from syncing additional data to your Vero account &ndash; helping you keep things simple, tidy and easy to keep track of. It means you can send data to Vero in exactly the format it&rsquo;s tracked, and easily transform it at the message level to create the most relevant content for your customers.</p>
<h2>Learning Liquid</h2>
<p>To help you get started with Liquid, we&rsquo;ve released <a href="https://www.getvero.com/email-personalization-liquid-guide">a guide to personalizing email and push messages using Liquid</a>. You may already be a pro with Liquid, but it might come in handy as a quick reference or to share with new team members, to help them get up to speed.</p>
<p>The Liquid guide gives you:</p>
<ul><li>An intro to Liquid and how it works</li>
<li>A summary of the most commonly used Liquid tags and filters for email and push messages</li>
<li>Examples of how you can use Liquid</li>
<li>Vero-specific Liquid shortcodes</li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;s just the top level stuff for now, but we&rsquo;ll continue to add more advanced Liquid functions and examples to the guide over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any suggestions or examples that you&rsquo;d like us to cover in our next update.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.getvero.com/email-personalization-liquid-guide">the guide</a> and improve your customers&rsquo; experience today.</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>We&rsquo;re close to releasing mobile push notifications and, in anticipation, I wanted to share what this feature will encompass and how it will fit into your workflow.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, we&rsquo;ve been working hard to bring you two powerful new tools:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.getvero.com/workflows/">Workflows</a> (now live) &ndash; a visual canvas that makes it easy to design and manage complex customer journeys.</li>
<li>Support for multiple messaging channels, the first addition being iOS and Android push notifications. </li>
</ul><p>Together these tools enable you to send timely, personal and actionable messages to your customers, on their preferred channels.</p>
<h1>Mobile push notifications in Vero </h1>
<p>We&rsquo;re super excited by the release of mobile push notifications as they introduce the first new messaging channel to sit alongside email in Vero. By opening up the channels through which you can communicate with your customers, we&rsquo;re giving you a whole new set of tools to engage your customers and ensure that they have a great experience with your business.</p>
<p>For many customers, Vero has become a &ldquo;defacto&rdquo; CRM and the central data store for rich data used to create targeted messages and interact with customers. Going beyond emails gives you more ways to use this data and increase the value of your integration with Vero.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7760" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-ios-android-push-notifications/push-node2x/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?fit=1200%2C620&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Push notifications" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?fit=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?fit=1024%2C529&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=1200%2C620&#038;ssl=1" alt="Push notifications" width="1200" height="620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7760" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=300%2C155&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=768%2C397&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Node@2x.png?resize=1024%2C529&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built a dedicated, user-friendly and powerful UI for creating iOS and Android push messages, to provide an experience on par with Vero&rsquo;s email creation process.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into the design and approach, including how channel data is stored on user profiles, how push notification tracking is handled and how the campaign creation process is structured.</p>
<p>In adding our first new channel to sit alongside email, we also re-architected several components of Vero to allow mobile push notifications to be the first of many new channels and integrations.</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>Below is a summary of the key things you need to know regarding the upcoming release. We&rsquo;ve also written a <a href="https://help.getvero.com/articles/mobile-push-notification-integration-guide.html">detailed integration guide</a>. Whilst this feature is in beta, feel free to read and provide feedback on the integration process as we prepare for the full release of this feature. We&rsquo;ll be adding more help docs soon.</p>
<h2>Selecting a delivery provider</h2>
<p>From customer feedback, it was clear that the majority of customers leverage either AWS SNS or Twilio for their push infrastructure and they would like to extend the value of these two providers with Vero.  The first version of our push notification support will include integrations with both these providers and we intend to add more in the future. </p>
<p>Similar to Vero&rsquo;s support for Mailgun, Sendgrid, Mailjet and other email delivery platforms, you will be able to add one or more <em>Providers</em> to handle push and choose on a campaign-by-campaign basis which provider to use.</p>
<h2>Managing multiple devices and tokens</h2>
<p>Unlike email addresses, it is feasible for customers to:</p>
<ul><li>have one or more devices,</li>
<li>uninstall and reinstall applications; and</li>
<li>have devices across platforms (ie. both iOS and Android)</li>
</ul><p>For this reason, Vero will support multiple device tokens per customer profile in Vero so that you can easily add and manage tokens for each customer.</p>
<p>Vero will support adding tokens via API and CSV. To integrate fully, we anticipate customers passing the token to Vero from their backend as part of the push notification registration. In the majority of cases, we have seen that customers are already doing this in some form or another as part of their current integration with AWS or Twilio, so Vero&rsquo;s integration should be straightforward compared with installing and shipping a Vero-specific SDK in a new version of your application.</p>
<h2>Creating a campaign with push notifications</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve built a separate, dedicated UI for creating a push notification instead of an email. This includes both a basic editor for the main push notification controls and an advanced editor for those who wish to edit the full JSON payloads.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="7763" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-ios-android-push-notifications/push-editor-basic2x/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?fit=1200%2C674&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,674" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Push message Editor" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?fit=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=1200%2C674&#038;ssl=1" alt="Push message Editor " width="1200" height="674" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7763" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Push-Editor-Basic@2x.png?resize=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>In the upcoming release, Vero will support Android and iOS push messages and our editor will be designed to work seamlessly with this pairing. This includes a preview of the push message on each platform and targeting options to limit the send to iOS, Android or both as desired.</p>
<p>The editor will otherwise mirror the email campaign creation process so it should be easy to use and familiar.</p>
<p>Similar to email, you will have the option to send a push notification as a newsletter campaign or add as an action step in a workflow.</p>
<h2>Measuring customer engagement </h2>
<p>Measuring customer engagement with iOS and Android push notifications is centered on tracking &ldquo;did a user open this message&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve extended our API to make it easy to track this engagement. By incorporating a few lines of code in your application as part of your iOS/ Android push notification handling, you can track and monitor the performance of your push notifications directly in Vero. </p>
<p>Performance metrics for push notifications will be available to view on the action step in your workflow, and in the Reports section of your account.</p>
<h1>When is it coming?</h1>
<p>Push notifications will be released in beta next week. If you haven&rsquo;t already, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Iiqw8Ba3lpQBSan9znKwHoOM9qXhL560l53zwLbv8dK_CA/viewform">sign up for the beta</a> and get early access: we&rsquo;re excited to get your feedback as we finalize this new feature.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to push this feature live!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>We&rsquo;re excited to tell you that Workflows are now available to all our customers!<br>
This new feature will make it easier and faster for you to design and manage your email journeys in Vero. Whether your journeys are simple or complex, Workflows empower you to communicate with your customers more confidently.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we shared that we&rsquo;d been building out Workflows and included <a href="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/">notes on our design approach and the key features</a>. We&rsquo;ve had Workflows in beta for some time now and we&rsquo;ve received some great feedback, so we&rsquo;re excited to see it go live today!</p>
<h2>Design journeys with clarity and confidence</h2>
<p>By using a canvas with point-and-click nodes, we have strived to make it as easy as possible to design any customer journey, whether it&rsquo;s short or long, simple or complex.</p>

<p>This level of visibility ensures any member of your team can easily pick up from where you left off and confidently update and optimize campaigns.</p>
<h2>Easily monitor performance and optimize campaigns</h2>
<p>Along with performance statistics shown on each action step, workflow insights are displayed in the sidebar allowing you to easily track customers, monitor the performance, identify areas for improvement, and make changes &ndash; all in one place.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve published a workflow, you&rsquo;ll often want to come back and make adjustments to optimize email content, timing and other variables. Steps can be moved during a live workflow, so you can easily adjust your campaigns as you learn and gain insights into your customers&rsquo; behaviour.</p>

<p>Vero will provide helpful messages to keep you right when making changes to live workflows.</p>
<h2>The little things matter</h2>
<p>Our goal has been to ensure Workflows are a joy to use. Some of the details we&rsquo;ve focused on include:</p>
<ul><li>Basic configuration of each step is immediately visible on the canvas, and the sidebar gives access to all of the configuration options, to provide clarity of functionality when designing and amending the details of each step.</li>
<li>Color-coded steps to help you see what&rsquo;s happening at a glance and make it easy to identify different aspects of your workflow.</li>
<li>Zooming and panning features mean you can easily view both simple and complex (long!) messaging workflows. Whether it&rsquo;s two steps or 200, our shortcut buttons and keys make it easy for you to fly around your canvas.</li>
</ul><h2>Coming soon!</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Workflows is that it provides almost endless possibilities to help you better communicate with your customers across channels and in more specific, action-oriented ways.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve already designed several feature additions and extensions we&rsquo;re excited to roll out over the coming months. These include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Mobile push notifications</strong><br>
We&rsquo;re adding support for Twilio and AWS SNS as an action step within Workflows within the next few weeks. This will enable a whole new world of cross-channel possibilities!
</li>
<li><strong>Convergence</strong><br>
One of the most powerful components of Workflows is the ability to branch indefinitely. Similarly, there are times when it makes sense to &ldquo;converge&rdquo; branches too, bringing a journey back to a central point. We&rsquo;re exploring ways to ensure your journeys are as simple, transparent and powerful as possible and convergence is near the top of the list.
</li>
<li><strong>A/B testing</strong><br>
There is lots of room for expansion in A/B testing capability with Workflows, including allowing you to A/B test varying branches of a journey. A/B testing is a nuanced area, and we&rsquo;re excited to incorporate your feedback as we build out these features.
</li>
</ul><p>There&rsquo;s a lot of scope beyond the above, for what&rsquo;s possible, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to your feedback and comments, as we build on this awesome feature!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Helloprint was started in 2013 by four young guys with a dream, and quickly it became an international e-commerce player with more than 150 team members. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="https://www.helloprint.co.uk">Helloprint</a>, it&rsquo;s an online printer that offers everything from booklets to roller banners, it now operates in 8 countries with millions of visitors each year. The Dutch-based start-up is considered one of the fastest growing e-commerce platforms in Europe and it won the Deloitte Fast 50 Rising Star 2016.</p>
<p>The CRM team at Helloprint focuses on delivering highly-personalised email experiences to help drive revenue and to reduce support queries. Impressed by their email campaigns and what they&rsquo;ve achieved, I was excited when their CTO, Michael Heerkens, and Head of CRM, Julien Catani made some time to chat with me.</p>
<h2>Choosing a data-first solution</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Syncing new data with our previous systems was a lot of work, and the possibility of error was high&rdquo; &ndash; Michael</p></blockquote>
<p>Before Vero, the Helloprint team used a system that allowed them to send email newsletters with basic list segmentation. Transactional emails were incorporated into their e-commerce system, a system in which they encountered many restrictions &ndash; for example, the only available email trigger was based on a change made to the customer&rsquo;s order status.</p>
<p>Michael needed a solution that would provide the Helloprint team with the flexibility to design highly personalised data-driven emails, and allow them to efficiently manage these communications in multiple languages.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was really important for us to be able to trigger emails on events and not have any limitations on what we wanted to send.&rdquo; &ndash; Michael</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Hellprint&rsquo;s engineering team simply add properties to a data object and Vero automatically accepts it. The same applies to new event triggers.</p>
<h2>Designing event-driven email campaigns</h2>
<p>8 online shops, 6 languages and 7,000+ customisable products make for a complex set of criteria for personalised email marketing, but Vero provided Helloprint&rsquo;s engineering and marketing team with the functionality they needed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vero balances the requirements for both our engineering and marketing teams perfectly, enabling them to work together effectively and move quickly&rdquo; &ndash; Michael</p></blockquote>
<p>With the Vero and Segment integration, it was a matter of ticking a box, putting in an API key and getting started with an initial transactional email immediately. The team was able to set up their first campaign in just a few hours. Vero&rsquo;s event management features give the CRM team the clear visibility and control to quickly create new data-driven email marketing campaigns. From template amendments to campaign automation, Vero offers all the tools and flexibility needed in a fast-paced environment like Helloprint.</p>
<p>HelloPrint&rsquo;s CRM team use Vero&rsquo;s <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/event-manager">event placeholders</a> to design and build new personalised email campaigns. These placeholders allow the team to move quickly when creating new campaigns and to map their exact data requirements.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vero enables us to use real-time data to enrich our emails with relevant content to drive a higher ROI&rdquo; &ndash; Julien</p></blockquote>
<p>For more complicated projects the marketing team still works closely with the engineering team to make sure that every new integration works perfectly. Vero&rsquo;s data and event management features make it easy for both teams to collaborate on designing and testing new campaigns.</p>
<h2>Building personalised campaigns</h2>
<p>The simplicity of adding and managing event data, in combination with <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/multi-language-campaigns/">Multi-language Campaigns</a> and <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion/">Fusion</a> has played a crucial role in allowing Helloprint to develop the email experience they envisioned.</p>
<p>Fusion is a Vero-specific feature that lets you enrich emails with data pulled directly from both internal and public APIs, at the exact time that emails are being sent. Loading data directly from the source in this way ensures communications are accurate and timely. Fusion enabled Helloprint to streamline their customer experience from email through to their website and onto purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We use Vero&rsquo;s Fusion feature to insert external attributes in almost every campaign now. It&rsquo;s been very powerful for us!&rdquo; &ndash; Michael</p></blockquote>
<p>Helloprint customers now receive a highly personalised email experience, which includes offering unique, customised product recommendations. For example, one of their email campaigns includes an image of the recommended product displaying the customer&rsquo;s logo &ndash; the customer can then click the email to visit the Helloprint website where their logo is embedded, and they can continue to directly purchase their personalised product.</p>
<h2>Delivering customers helpful and engaging content</h2>
<p>For a company selling over 7,000 customisable products, it is critical to understand the different needs of customers and provide a tailored experience. For example, business customers buying promotional products and consumers buying printed canvases have very different requirements.</p>
<p>Helloprint now has 100+ transactional emails in 6 different languages set up in Vero. Every single order placed by a customer triggers a specific transactional sequence based on several criteria such as the payment method, the creative and the product type. These sequences inform Helloprint customers in real-time about their order status, reducing the number of contact moments with the Helloprint customer service team without sacrificing customer experience. Every single transactional sequence has now been mapped in Vero with success, and the marketing team has more time to develop behavioural email campaigns that focus on increasing revenue.</p>
<p>Through a rigorous testing and optimisation process, the team has been able to increase customer engagement and revenue through email.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&hellip;we moved from a mass mailing approach to a personalised customer communication journey. By doing that, we now trigger the right message at the right time for every single customer.&rdquo; &ndash; Julien</p></blockquote>
<h2>HelloPrint increased their NPS by 35%</h2>
<p>The proof is in the pudding, since March 2016 when Helloprint implemented Vero as their unique email tool, they have seen a huge improvement in customer happiness metrics.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vero helped us to significantly improve our NPS.&rdquo; &ndash; Michael</p></blockquote>
<p>In 24 months, Helloprint&rsquo;s Net Promoter Score (NPS) increased by 35% which really showcases the level of engagement customers have with the Helloprint brand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>One of the big projects Vero has planned this year is the release of our new campaign workflows for email communications and mobile push notifications. This new feature will give you a more visual way to design and manage your customer journeys. We&rsquo;ve been delighted with the initial rounds of feedback and we&rsquo;re getting ready to launch in the next few weeks, so we thought you might like a sneak preview.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>At Vero, we know that team collaboration and visibility of your data is key to designing and successfully implementing personalized email campaigns. While Vero&rsquo;s current email campaign tools are very powerful, the current linear campaign builder doesn&rsquo;t offer complete visibility of an email journey in one view.</p>
<p>We spent time speaking to both our new and long-time customers to understand the areas where we can improve how you can build and manage campaigns:</p>
<ol><li>It is sometimes hard to have confidence in where customers are in their email journey. This fear can sometimes hold users back from further developing a workflow and adding more sophisticated and personalized email campaigns.
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of Vero customers have tens, or in some cases, hundreds of automated email campaigns. Collaboration at scale can be tough &ndash; people think differently and it can be hard for one Vero user to &ldquo;follow the logic&rdquo; of campaigns set up by their teammate, which can often make updating or changing them daunting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of branching leads to duplication. Vero&rsquo;s current interface enables very detailed functionality, but it&rsquo;s linear nature often means duplicating a whole workflow in order to adjust one or a few elements of the workflow. Introducing ways to achieve personalization without duplication is a critical goal of Vero&rsquo;s new campaign workflows.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2 id="campaign-workflow-highlights">New campaign workflow highlights</h2>
<p>Our key goal in designing this new campaign workflow was to make it as easy as possible for anyone, on any team, to collaborate on customer messages and to have confidence in what customers will receive. We&rsquo;re delighted to share this preview with you today.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7666" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/vcb2x/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?fit=1200%2C764&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,764" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Campaign workflow UI" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?fit=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?fit=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=1200%2C764&#038;ssl=1" alt="Campaign workflow" width="1200" height="764" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7666" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=300%2C191&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=768%2C489&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VCB@2x.png?resize=1024%2C652&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This new visual approach to building campaigns offers you a clean and clear view of all the logic, details and content that make-up highly engaging campaigns. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul><li>Color-coded steps help you see what&rsquo;s happening at a glance and make it easy to identify different aspects of your workflow. </li>
<li>The basic configuration of each step is immediately visible on the canvas, and the sidebar gives you detailed access to all of the configuration options for each, providing clarity of functionality when designing and amending the details of each step.</li>
<li>Zooming and panning features mean you can easily view both simple and complex (long!) messaging workflows. Whether it&rsquo;s two nodes or 200, our shortcut buttons and keys make it easy to fly around your canvas.</li>
</ul><p>Together, these features will give you, and your team, the visibility and clarity to move quickly, and confidently develop and improve your customer journeys.</p>
<h2>Modular and extensible</h2>
<p>Critical to the longevity of this feature is its modularity. The release of visual campaign workflows opens the door to possibilities that we could previously only imagine.<br>
We&rsquo;ve architected the new workflow manager with the future in mind. Not only will the first version improve on our current automation engine by including new functions such as branching, in the future, we&rsquo;ll be releasing several new nodes too such as push notifications &ndash; we&rsquo;ll be sharing more on that soon.</p>

<p>One of the major improvements that campaign workflows give over the current automated campaign interface in Vero is <strong>flexibility</strong>.</p>

<p>The position of each step in a campaign is no longer restricted. Steps can be moved around, giving you full control over the order of logic, delays, and emails. These steps can also be moved during a live campaign so you can adjust your campaign as you learn and gain insights into your customers&rsquo; behavior. We are confident this feature will provide a level of flexibility that will make creating and managing journeys much faster and simpler.</p>
<h2>Branching</h2>
<p>One of the best new features included in this release is the ability to add branching steps to a workflow. By adding logic that results in the customer moving down either a true or false path means you can tailor your customer journeys even further.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7668" data-permalink="https://www.getvero.com/resources/coming-soon-email-campaign-workflows/branch2x/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?fit=1200%2C628&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Campaign workflow branches" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?fit=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?fit=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i1.wp.com/veropublic.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=1200%2C628&#038;ssl=1" alt="Campaign workflow branches" width="1200" height="628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7668" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=768%2C402&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Branch@2x.png?resize=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We think managing your campaign logic like this will make planning and implementing customer journeys easier than ever. Not only does it mean you can skip the pen and paper, and plan out your campaigns directly in Vero, it also means you can combine multiple campaigns into a single workflow so you and your team can view more complex journeys on one canvas.</p>
<h2>Making changes</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got a series of customer emails up and running, you&rsquo;ll often want to come back and adjustments to optimize the content, timing and other variables.</p>
<p>Campaign workflows handle changes elegantly, ensuring that any design changes are not activated until you officially push them live. This lets you change email content or the entire node structure without worrying about affecting what your customers see &ndash; until you&rsquo;re happy with the changes.</p>
<h2>Clarity at every step</h2>
<p>By introducing a canvas for designing campaigns you can create more sophisticated, and longer email sequences with many branches. Setting a &ldquo;goal&rdquo; for the workflow not only offers clarity around when customers are or are not in a workflow, it drives conversion tracking across the workflow as a whole &ndash; aggregating conversions across the individual messages and reporting the success of the workflow in one place.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also ensured that you can easily reference workflows when designing segments or other workflows, using the condition &ldquo;Has entered workflow&rdquo;. This gives you extra power for all of your detailed campaign design needs.</p>
<hr><p>A couple of the features I&rsquo;ve previewed today are still in the works, but we&rsquo;re nearly ready to show you what we&rsquo;ve built. We&rsquo;ll start to open up our new visual campaign workflows to a small number of beta customers in the coming weeks.<br>
If you&rsquo;re interested in being part of the beta group, send us an email support@getvero.com.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re really excited to release this feature, and we hope you are too!</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Learn how to load weather, location and other data via APIs into the body of an email and use that data to personalize what a customer will receive.</p>
<p>This is an example of a welcome email campaign (perhaps a little exaggerated!) that includes details about the weather at the recipient&rsquo;s location, a map of their city and details on their nearest Vero support contact (based on our support team members in the US, EU, and Australia).</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s so special about personalizing emails with data loaded from APIs?</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s special here is that the data being loaded and the decisions on which content to render and how to render it is handled <strong>at send time</strong>. The data is loaded dynamically in real time for each individual recipient &ndash; this is a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re an engineer, a product manager or a marketer, you&rsquo;ve probably encountered one of these scenarios:</p>
<ol><li>You need to access data for your emails but that data <strong>changes frequently</strong> (product inventory, latest product releases, price changes) and this data is only pushed into your email marketing tool on a daily basis or when customers happen to log in.</li>
<li>You need access to data for each individual user and that data needs to be (or is best) <strong>generated</strong> &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; (dynamic coupons, an invite code, a map).</li>
<li>You need access to data that is the result of a <strong>complex algorithmic</strong> or analytic process (user-level recommendations, counts on large data stores, etc.).</li>
<li>You have an internal API you&rsquo;ve <strong>already built</strong> out that contains all of the user data you might want in order to personalise an email, but writing middleware to push this data into an email tool is complex, unwarranted or will result in data being out of sync with the internal API.</li>
<li>You can combine internal data already in your email tool with <strong>data loaded directly from a third party</strong> (weather, another vendor) to get the desired result, saving you building your own middleware.</li>
</ol><p>If so, <a href="https://veropublic.wpengine.com/fusion">Fusion</a> is a solution we&rsquo;ve built to help ensure you&rsquo;ve got access to the data in all of the scenarios above.</p>
<p>We think Fusion is pretty special in helping us help you achieve your personalization goals.</p>
<h2>How we set this up</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://github.com/getvero/fusion-welcome-email">HTML of the email</a> we&rsquo;re using in Vero to build out this example.</p>
<p>This file is made up of two main components.</p>
<h3>1. Loading in the required data</h3>
<p>Vero uses the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers">Liquid</a> templating language in order to customise email content.</p>
<p>One of Liquid&rsquo;s most powerful features is the <code>capture</code> function (<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers#variable-assignment">more here</a>). In this example we&rsquo;re using a combination of Vero&rsquo;s custom <code>fetch_json</code> method, which loads a remote <code>JSON</code> data feed into the outgoing email and the Liquid <code>capture</code> function in order to load all of the data we&rsquo;ll use in the body of the email.</p>
<p>As a first step, we&rsquo;ll use Fusion in conjunction with <a href="https://clearbit.com">Clearbit</a> in order to load the user&rsquo;s demographic data. We&rsquo;ll then use <code>capture</code> to store the user&rsquo;s city and country in a format we can use with weather and mapping APIs.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Get information about the user from Clearbit --&gt;
  {%fetch_json clearbit = 'https://REDACTED:""@person.clearbit.com/v1/people/email/{{user.email}}'%}

  &lt;!-- Set the location variable as we want to use it for other API requests (and in the copy!) --&gt;
  {%capture location%}{{json.clearbit.geo.city}}, {{json.clearbit.geo.country}}{%endcapture%}
</code></pre>
<p>This will output something like <code>Sydney, Australia</code> for my test user (<code>chris@getvero.com</code>).</p>
<p>We then build on this by using a combination of a weather API to get the current weather data in the user&rsquo;s city.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Get weather data --&gt;
  {%fetch_json weather = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={{location}}&amp;amp;APPID=REDACTED'%}
</code></pre>
<p>These are some nice, clean examples of using Vero&rsquo;s Fusion functionality and some of Liquid&rsquo;s basic functionality. We use the data we&rsquo;ve fetched above to insert a map, which Google cleverly lets us do in a raw <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center={{location}}&amp;amp;zoom=14&amp;amp;size=600x250&amp;amp;key=REDACTED&amp;amp;markers=color:red|{{location}}"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We also use it to insert the weather and a weather icon.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;At Vero, we're all about personalisation. In this email we wanted to show you a little of what's possible. For example, when we sent you this email we could see that it was &lt;strong&gt;{{json.weather["main"]["temp"]}}&Acirc;&deg;F&lt;/strong&gt; with you &acirc;&#128;&#147;&nbsp;"{{json.weather.weather.first.description}}" according to the weather report! &lt;img src="http://openweathermap.org/img/w/{{json.weather.weather.first.icon}}.png"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>To really show off what Liquid rendering can do when it comes to personalisation given the full power of a JSON feed at your command, the final part of our example results in simple content output displaying how far the user who has signed up is from our a local support team member at Vero but uses some complex logic.</p>
<p>To do this we: </p>
<ul><li>We <code>assign</code> an array with three of our top locations with support team members.</li>
<li>We use Google&rsquo;s Distances API to get the distance of each support member in the above array from the user who has signed up. This results in either a distance result in miles, where Google can find the distance (generally requires a road connection in order to work!) or nothing.
<p>        <!-- Get distances --></p>
<pre><code>  {%fetch_json distances = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/json?units=imperial&amp;amp;origins={{location}}&amp;amp;destinations=Seattle,USA|Brisbane,Australia|Amsterdam,Netherlands&amp;amp;travelMode=Driving&amp;amp;key=REDACTED'%}
        </code></pre>
</li>
<li>We iterate through the three possible options and find the minimum distance (i.e. the closest team member).
<p>        <!-- Find local support contact --></p>
<pre><code>  {%assign min_value = 0%}
          {%assign min_index = 0%}
          {%for row in json.distances.rows.first.elements%} 
            {%unless row.status == 'ZERO_RESULTS'%}
              {%if forloop.index0 == 01%}
                {%assign min_value = row.distance.value%}
                {%assign min_index = forloop.index%}
              {%elsif forloop.index0 != 01 and row.distance.value &lt; min_value%}
                {%assign min_value = row.distance.value%}
                {%assign min_index = forloop.index%}
              {%endif%}
            {%endunless%}
          {%endfor%}
          {%assign actual_index = min_index|minus:1%}
        </code></pre>
</li>
<li>We assign the index of that team member in the assigned array, so that we can refer to the details of the array later.</li>
</ul><p>This then enables us to print out the city of the closest support representative and how far away that is in miles:</p>
<pre><code>As we mentioned, we're based all over the world. One reason for this is we want to provide our customers with the best support possible. From where you are, your nearest support contact is based in {{json.distances.destination_addresses[actual_index]}} &acirc;&#128;&#147; that's <strong>{{json.distances.rows.first.elements[actual_index].distance.text}}</strong> away! We've got team members in Australia, the Netherlands and the USA to help out when it comes to support.
</code></pre>
<p>The result is a super personal email that has been built <strong>on the fly</strong> by Vero&rsquo;s rendering engine, thanks to the power of APIs and Liquid.</p>

<li>Save the email and use the <em>Preview in browser</em> function to fully render an example version of the email (make sure you preview <em>as the test user</em> in order to render things correctly).</li>
<li>Voila!</li>
</ol><p>Remember: bad emails feel &ldquo;clunky&rdquo;. Great emails:</p>
<ul><li>inform your customers</li>
<li>make sense based on their other interactions with your business, and</li>
<li>are &ldquo;just another part of your customer experience&rdquo;.</li>
</ul><p>To make an email great, you need data. Not only data about who your customer is, but data about their touch points with your business, data that relates to their location or position, or data related to your business (new releases, inventory, metrics, etc.). Fusion is a powerful tool that will help you achieve this.</p>

<html><body><p>When A/B testing an email newsletter you can now let Vero automatically pick and send the winning email to the remaining recipients. Vero makes A/B testing easy to manage while providing the level of accuracy required to ensure your tests are robust so that you can confidently optimize the performance of your campaigns.</p>
<h3>Winning metrics that matter</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re in control of the parameters used for your A/B tests. Define the <em>time to wait</em> before the winning variance is selected, the <em>percentage of customers to use in the test</em> and the <em>metric to determine the winner</em>.</p>
<p>You can choose from the following metrics to determine which variation wins:</p>
<ul><li>Deliveries</li>
<li>Opens</li>
<li>Clicks</li>
<li>Unsubscribes (the variant with more unsubscribes will be discarded)</li>
<li>Conversions (the number of users that took an action after receiving the campaign, such as a purchase).</li>

<p>You can select from two options to determine the winner:</p>
<h3>Biggest number</h3>
<p>In this scenario, Vero will select the email with the biggest number of the chosen metric as the winner (with exception of unsubscribes, where the variant with the biggest number will be discarded).</p>
<h3>Statistical significance</h3>
<p>Statistical significance brings mathematical accuracy to your testing. If one of your email variations observes an improvement on the control email with a confidence level of 95%, it will be selected as the winning email and sent to the remaining audience.  If no statistically significant difference is observed between the email variations, Vero will send the control email to the remaining audience.</p>

<html><body><p>Vero&rsquo;s Fusion functionality allows you to access your most accurate data when you need it.</p>
<p>With Fusion you can <strong>pull data</strong> from your own internal APIs or public API endpoints right before emails are sent, providing the accuracy and timeliness needed to deliver your customers a truly personalized experience.</p>
<p>Many of our customers have been using Fusion over the last few months and we&rsquo;ve been delighted with the feedback. Today we&rsquo;re excited to offer Fusion to all our customers!</p>
<h2>Load data from its source</h2>
<p>Vero&rsquo;s Fusion uses APIs to access data where it originates: directly from internal databases or third-party platforms. Using Fusion follows a simple two-step process:</p>
<p><strong>Connect an API endpoint</strong></p>
<p>Add the URL of your external data source to an email using <strong>Vero&rsquo;s Data Inspector</strong>. To enable loading individual, specific user and event data, Vero can pass identifying attributes with each API request (such as a user&rsquo;s ID or email).</p>
<p><strong>Add data to emails using Liquid</strong></p>
<p>Data is loaded for access using the HTML templating language Liquid. This enables you to access the full JSON object and insert attributes (or HTML) into your email content, just this: <code>{{external.user_region}}</code>.</p>
<hr><section id="external-attributes-code" class="flush-bottom"><div class="inner center-text">
<div>
<p class="smallish semi-bold no-margin">Example API endpoint</p>
<p class="no-top-margin">https://api.yoursite.com/people-you-may-know/{{user.id}}</p>
</div>
<div class="ext-example">

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>When it comes to basic data analytics, there are three key things that have changed over the last few years:</p>
<ol><li>It is easier than ever to set up a data warehouse with virtually no data limits, such as Amazon&rsquo;s AWS Redshift or Google&rsquo;s Big Query.</li>
<li>It is easier than ever to synchronize data from SaaS products into such warehouses, with tools like Stitch and Segment.</li>
<li>There are several easy-to-use, effective tools that make it trivial to query and chart the plethora of data in your warehouse in a sophisticated way, such as Mode Analytics and Looker.</li>
</ol><p>At Vero, we&rsquo;re big proponents of these advancements and how these tools work together. In most scenarios, the &ldquo;data pipeline&rdquo; outlined above is superior to tools like Mixpanel and Amplitude as it enables greater data accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p>In this guide, I&rsquo;m going to introduce you to storing and analyzing data directly in Amazon&rsquo;s Redshift using <a href="https://www.getdbt.com">DBT</a> and Mode Analytics. We&rsquo;re going to chart some the basic SaaS metrics of MRR upgrades, downgrades, new and churned MRR to get started.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve included the actual SQL we use at Vero, and I&rsquo;ve broken down how it works so you can use it, get inspired by it or build upon it.</p>
<p>The full repository of SQL can be found <a href="https://github.com/getvero/dbt-saas">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can apply the same approach I use here to chart virtually <em>anything</em> with this setup, it&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<h2>Charting upgrades, downgrades, new revenue and churn</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the chart we&rsquo;ll be building (note that &ldquo;news&rdquo; means new MRR in this chart):</p>
<figure class=" small-image" style="px"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/dha4w82d62smt.cloudfront.net/items/2C3x2J321G3B1X2M3H33/charting-mrr-movements-sql-dbt-redshift.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure><h2>What you&rsquo;ll need for graphing net churn</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the setup you&rsquo;ll need to get accurate and complete data and to chart it beautifully:</p>
<ul><li>An AWS Redshift database to store all of your data.</li>
<li>StitchData to synchronise data from Stripe (or your invoicing platform) to Redshift.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com">DBT</a> to turn the unorganised, raw data that is synchronised from Stripe into Redshift into clean database &ldquo;views&rdquo; you can query to create pretty charts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sinterdata.com">Sinter</a> to run <code>DBT</code> queries daily (or more often) so that your charts are up to date.</li>
<li>Mode Analytics to query the clean database views generated by DBT and Sinter to create beautiful charts.</li>
</ul><p>All up, these components cost around $480 USD per month. They&rsquo;re all scalable to virtually any limit, so you can rest assured they&rsquo;ll scale with you as you grow.</p>
<h2>Synchronising your data to Redshift</h2>
<h2>The SQL</h2>
<p>To help you, we&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/getvero/dbt-saas">pulled together a Github repository</a> with all of the SQL needed to create these charts. As you become more familiar with DBT, you&rsquo;ll observe that this repository is structured in line with DBT&rsquo;s best practices and is a module that you should be able to import into another DBT project.</p>
<p>The SQL here ultimately outputs a table called <code>revenue_movements</code>. This table contains one row for each month and one column each of the metrics <code>new_revenue</code>, <code>churned_revenue</code>, <code>upgrade_revenue</code> and <code>downgrade_revenue</code>.</p>
<p>The resulting table can easily be queried using a tool like Mode.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I recommend you download the <a href="getvero.com">full SQL</a> and follow along in a text editor like Sublime.</p>
<p>Below I&rsquo;ll step through each of the SQL queries used to build up the <code>revenue_movements</code> view.</p>
<h3>Getting a nice clean list of all invoices</h3>
<p>All of the SQL we&rsquo;ll be writing here is formatted in line with the structure outlined by DBT. Every SQL query is a <code>SELECT</code> and results in a table or view. This table or view can then be used by other DBT queries. This &ldquo;stacking&rdquo; helps create clean and reusable SQL. You can read more about <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/viewpoint">DBT&rsquo;s viewpoint / manifest here</a>.</p>
<p>Onto the SQL! The first step in the process of creating our chart is to generate a view called <code>stripe_invoices</code> that has a row for every single customer invoice.</p>
<p>When using <code>DBT</code>, I like to follow a standard structure for my SQL code inside the <code>models</code> folder:</p>
<ul><li>I have a folder named after the source of the data, e.g. <code>stripe</code>.</li>
<li>Within that folder I always have a <code>base</code> folder. The SQL files inside the <code>base</code> folder are responsible for querying the underlying raw dataset and returning <strong>only</strong> the columns needed by our queries later on.
<ul><li>I will also do exclusions in these SQL files if I have any. </li>
<li>Files in this folder are always named using the format <code>PROVIDER_MODEL.sql</code>, for example <code>stripe_invoices.sql</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I also have a <code>transform</code> folder. The SQL in this folder is responsible for taking the <code>base</code> output, e.g. <code>stripe_invoices</code>, and converting values into a more usable format, where useful.
<ul><li>These files are always named with the <code>_xf</code> suffix, as in <code>stripe_invoices_xf.sql</code>.</li>
<li>Critically, the base SQL should never be queried other than by it&rsquo;s corresponding transform query. The point is that <strong>all queries</strong> from here on use the <strong>transformed</strong> models, and never directly call the base models. This gives everything a reliable structure with a <strong>lot</strong> of flexibility. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Here&rsquo;s the SQL from the <code>stripe_invoices</code> base table:</p>
<pre><code>select
  id                      as id,
  amount_due              as amount_due,
  customer                as customer,
  date                    as date,
  period_end              as period_end,
  forgiven                as forgiven,
  paid                    as paid,
  subscription            as subscription,
  total                   as total,
  starting_balance        as starting_balance
from
  {{ var('invoices_table') }}
where
  -- Remove customer IDs of users who will mess up MRR and other figures (e.g test accounts)
  customer not in ('cus_3Ma5IxIINayMgK')
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s pretty basic. The next step is to add in a few transformations. </p>
<p>In this particular example, I want to include customers&rsquo; <code>email</code> addresses, but this data is not available in the raw Stripe invoices table, so I need to join another table to get it. Similarly, I want to include an index of the invoice number for each customer (i.e. first invoice, last invoice, etc.) so I&rsquo;ll add a query for this.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the transform SQL:</p>
<pre><code>with 

stripe_invoices_with_line_items as (
  select 
    * 
  from 
    {{ ref('stripe_invoices_with_line_items_xf_aggregated') }}
), 

usage_based_recipients as (
  select
    *
  from
    {{ ref('usage_based_recipients') }}
)

select 
  stripe_invoices.id                              as id,
  stripe_invoices.customer                        as customer,
  stripe_customers_xf.email                       as customer_email,
  stripe_invoices.date                            as date,
  stripe_invoices.period_end                      as period_end,
  stripe_invoices.forgiven                        as forgiven,
  stripe_invoices.subscription                    as subscription,
  stripe_invoices.paid                            as paid,
  stripe_invoices_with_line_items.total           as total,
  row_number() over(
    partition by stripe_invoices.customer 
    order by stripe_invoices.date desc
  )                                               as last_payment,
  row_number() over(
    partition by stripe_invoices.customer 
    order by stripe_invoices.date asc
  )                                               as first_payment
from 
  {{ ref('stripe_invoices') }} stripe_invoices
left outer join
  stripe_invoices_with_line_items
on
  stripe_invoices.id = stripe_invoices_with_line_items.id
left outer join
  {{ ref('stripe_customers_xf') }} as stripe_customers_xf
on
  stripe_customers_xf.id = stripe_invoices.customer
</code></pre>
<p>As you an see, I&rsquo;m leveraging another transformed dataset, the <code>customers_xf</code> table. The <code>invoices_xf</code> resulting from the above query has all of the data I might want later.</p>
<h3>Querying for new revenue per month</h3>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve done to the hard work of creating a clean table of all of our customer invoices, it is relatively easy to query for revenue movements.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with &ldquo;new revenue per month&rdquo;, as per the file <code>mrr_new.sql</code>:</p>
<pre><code>select
  date_trunc('month', date) as month,
  sum(total)
from
  {{ref('invoices_by_customer')}}
where
  -- Find customers who had their first invoice this month
  asc_row = 1 
group by
  date_trunc('month', date)
</code></pre>
<p>This SQL finds all of the initial invoices for each customer and groups and sums them by month (e.g. January, February, etc.). You&rsquo;ll note that the SQL leverages a table called <code>invoices_by_customer.sql</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with 

invoices_by_customer as (
  select
    customer_id,
    date_trunc('month',date) as month,
    sum(total) as total
  from
    {{ ref('invoices') }}
  group by
    customer_id,
    date_trunc('month',date)
)

select 
  *,
  row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by month asc)   as asc_row 
  row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by month desc)  as desc_row 
from 
  invoices_by_customer
</code></pre>
<p>This SQL groups the invoices by customer and month. This interim step is key as it is possible in Stripe that customers have two invoices in a single month. This aggregation ensures that for each month there is just one total &ldquo;invoiced&rdquo; count per customer. The <code>asc_row</code> thus accurately represents an index for each customer&rsquo;s invoices starting in the first month they paid and counting upwards. </p>
<h3>Querying for upgrades per month</h3>
<p>Querying for upgrades requires comparing two months and determining the difference between those two months. The SQL is located in <code>mrr_upgrades.sql</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with

find_upgrades as (
  select 
    invoices.month                                                as month,
    invoices.asc_row                                              as asc_row,
    invoices.total                                                as current_month_total,
    coalesce(invoices_offset_one_month.total,0)                   as last_month_total,
    invoices.total - coalesce(invoices_offset_one_month.total,0)  as change
  from 
    {{ref('invoices_by_customer')}} invoices
  left outer join 
    {{ref('invoices_by_customer')}} invoices_offset_one_month
  on 
    add_months(invoices.month, -1) = invoices_offset_one_month.month
  and 
    invoices.customer_id = invoices_offset_one_month.customer_id
)

select
  month         as month,
  sum(change)   as revenue
from
  upgrades
where
  -- Only include customers whose current month total is more than last month (upgrades!)
  abs(upgrades.current_month_total) &gt; 
  upgrades.last_month_total
and 
  -- Exclude customers who didn't move plans this month
  upgrades.change &lt;&gt; 0 and upgrades.change is not null
and
  -- Exclude customer's first invoices, as these are actually "new" customers, not upgrades
  upgrades.asc_row &lt;&gt; 1
group by
  upgrades.month
</code></pre>
<p>This query leverages the same <code>invoices_by_customer</code> table twice &ndash; once to query the total for &ldquo;this month&rdquo; and once to query the total for &ldquo;last month&rdquo;. It then displays the <strong>difference</strong> each of these totals.</p>
<p>We also need to ensure we exclude:</p>
<ul><li>Customers that have their <em>first invoice</em> <strong>this</strong> month, as those are already counted in the earlier <code>mrr_new</code> query. They represent customers who are new and, as they didn&rsquo;t have an invoice prior to their starting, there will always be a change recorded in their first month.</li>
<li>Customers who have invoices with a total of <code>0</code> <em>this</em> month, as these are customers who have churned &ndash; we&rsquo;ll query them separately.</li>
<li>Customers who have a <em>negative</em> change, as these are customers who have downgraded since last month.</li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;re left with a clean table containing the upgrades per month across our invoice history.</p>
<h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
<p>The files <code>mrr_churns</code> and <code>mrr_downgrades</code> provide the SQL to chart these numbers. They are similar to the queries above.</p>
<p>With the key metrics of new revenue, churned revenue, upgrades and downgrades accounted for, we can now bring these figures together. DBT separates <code>models</code> (like those above) and <code>analysis</code> SQL files into two. I always put the final SQL that I will copy and paste into Mode into the <code>analysis</code> folder. The SQL within that folder represents each SQL query used to build our dashboards.</p>
<p>The file <code>revenue/mrr_movements.sql</code> joins the <code>mrr_new</code>, <code>mrr_upgrades</code>, <code>mrr_downgrades</code> and <code>mrr_churns</code> tables discussed above:</p>
<pre><code>select
  new_revenue.month,
  new_revenue.revenue         as new_revenue,
  churned_revenue.revenue     as churned_revenue,
  upgrade_revenue.revenue     as upgrade_revenue,
  downgrade_revenue.revenue   as downgrade_revenue
from
  {{ref('mrr_new')}} new_revenue
left outer join
  {{ref('mrr_churned')}} churned_revenue
on
  new_revenue.month = churned_revenue.month
left outer join
  {{ref('mrr_upgrades')}} upgrade_revenue
on
  new_revenue.month = upgrade_revenue.month
left outer join
  {{ref('mrr_downgrades')}} downgrade_revenue
on
  new_revenue.month = downgrade_revenue.month
where
  -- This works in Redshift, not in Postgres
  new_revenue.month &lt; date_trunc('month',dateadd(months,-1,current_date))
order by
  new_revenue.month desc
</code></pre>
<p>There are two important things about this query:</p>
<ul><li>Using <code>left outer join</code> ensures that if any of the joined tables are missing a value for a certain month, those months are included but with a <code>null</code> value.</li>
<li>We exclude the current month as always renders incomplete and shows generally alarming figures until the month ends.</li>
</ul><h2>Why use SQL at all?</h2>
<p>The thing I find most powerful about charting in this way is that the result is <code>idempotent</code>. This is a fancy engineering word that means &ldquo;you can run it hundreds of times and get the same output&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thanks to Stitch, Redshift, and DBT you can reload the raw data and re-run the queries and get the exact output every time. One of the challenges I&rsquo;ve always found with Amplitude, Mixpanel, and others is that sending data via API makes it easy to load raw data twice or to have poor visibility on <strong>which</strong> data <strong>is</strong> present. I feel this approach solves that.</p>
<p>On top of that, the beauty of using SQL for this sort of charting is that you can:</p>
<ul><li>Fully customise your charts.</li>
<li>Query across datasets and event databases, allowing you to do really sophisticated analyses. </li>
<li>Check your SQL code into GitHub or similar so you have a versioned history of every query and dashboard.</li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;ve found running SQL queries allows us to produce consolidated reports which actually get looked at and actioned. It&rsquo;s forced us to be selective about what we query and this may be one of the most valuable aspects of the whole thing!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;this script is slightly different from the one we use in production and has been pared down for this article, so if you see improvements or breaking code (though, it has been tested with our setup), please let me know and we&rsquo;ll update it.</p></body></html>
