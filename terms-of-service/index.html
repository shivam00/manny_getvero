<html><body><p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 12 June 2012<br><strong>Effective date:</strong> 12 June 2012</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Through the Axtrion software product, Invc.me Inc. (&ldquo;Axtrion&rdquo;) provides website operators and other individuals with a variety of tools and resources (including our website) to enable them to collect user and usage data and to enable website and application owners to send email messages efficiently to consumers based on their behavior (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Services are provided subject to these terms and conditions, which also incorporate our <a href="../privacy/index.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and any other guidelines, rules or operating policies that Axtrion may establish and post on our website from time to time (collectively the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). The servers we use to provide the Services (the &ldquo;Servers&rdquo;) are, unless otherwise agreed, located in the United States.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before proceeding with any use of our website or the Services. By using the website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and the Services you accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement.</p>
<p>If you do not accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please exit this website and cease using the Services immediately.</p>
<h2>1. Services and Support</h2>
<h3>1.1</h3>
<p>By posting updated versions of the Agreement on the Axtrion website, or otherwise providing notice to you, Axtrion may modify the terms of this Agreement and may discontinue or revise any or all other aspects of the Services at its sole discretion. All such changes shall become effective upon posting of the revised Agreement on the Axtrion website. Your continued use of the Services will constitute your acceptance of the variation to the Agreement. Axtrion will use reasonable efforts to make you aware of any changes to the terms of this Agreement. If you elect to discontinue using the Services due to any changes to the Agreement made under this section 1.1, you will be entitled to a refund for any unused, prepaid amounts for the Services.</p>
<h3>1.2</h3>
<p>The Services are available only to persons who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Services are not available to individuals under the age of 18. If you do not qualify, your use of the Services is expressly prohibited.</p>
<h3>1.3</h3>
<p>The Services include, but are not limited to, the offering of any materials displayed or performed on the Site and related features (including, but not limited to text, data, software, graphics, photographs, images, illustrations, audio clips and video clips, also known as the &ldquo;Content&rdquo;).</p>
<h3>1.4</h3>
<p>Both the number of email messages sent and the number of KiloBytes of data transferred are metered by Axtrion. Normal Axtrion accounts allow you to send an unlimited number of email messages. The total KiloByte data transfer of each message can be no more than 300kb.</p>
<h3>1.5</h3>
<p>All email delivery prices are subject to change at any time. All fees paid to Axtrion for the Services are non-refundable, unless an account is terminated by you under clause 1.1. Payment for Services must be made by a valid credit card accepted by Axtrion, unless other payment arrangements have been made between you and an authorized Axtrion representative. You hereby authorize Axtrion to charge your credit card whenever you use the Services to send a campaign to more than 5 recipients, or on a monthly basis if you select monthly pricing. Fees are payable in US dollars. If Axtrion is for any reason unable to effect automatic payment via your credit card, you will be notified via email. All prices are subject to change and you are responsible for reviewing the pricing schedule from time to time and for remaining aware of the fees charged by Axtrion for the Services.</p>
<h3>1.6</h3>
<p>Axtrion may change, suspend or discontinue the Services for any reason, at any time, including the availability of any feature or Content. Axtrion may also restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.</p>
<h3>1.7</h3>
<p>You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as requested in the registration form. As part of the registration process, you will identify an email address, username and password for your Axtrion account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, username, passwords, and files and for all uses of your account and of the Services in your name. Axtrion reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel accounts it deems inappropriate.</p>
<h3>1.8</h3>
<p>It is understood that Axtrion makes no guarantee that HTML messages will be rendered properly on all recipients&rsquo; email programs, due to the wide variety of HTML generation tools available. Axtrion makes every reasonable attempt to make sure that all email messages sent through our servers follow email standards, but we cannot guarantee that messages will look consistent across all email platforms due to the number of different HTML composition tools available. For example, if you use Microsoft Word to generate HTML email messages, it is expected that recipients of your message using a non-Microsoft email application may have difficulty reading your message. For best results Axtrion recommends the use of HTML editors that generate HTML that adheres to W3C standards.</p>
<h2>2. Customer Data</h2>
<h3>2.1</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that if you provide data regarding your end users or email campaigns to Axtrion in connection with your use of the Services (&ldquo;Customer Data&rdquo;), you hereby do and shall grant Axtrion a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable right to use, modify, reproduce, and display such Customer Data (including all related intellectual property rights) to (i) provide the Services and (ii) improve the Services&rsquo; ability to deliver web and application analytics services to you. You warrant, represent and agree that you have the right to grant Axtrion the rights set forth above. You represent and warrant that you own all right, title and interest, or possess sufficient license rights, in and to the Customer Data as may be necessary to permit the use contemplated under this Agreement. You bear all responsibility and liability for the accuracy, completeness, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right of the Customer Data and Axtrion&rsquo;s access, possession and use as permitted herein. You represent, warrant and agree that you will not contribute any Customer Data that (a) infringes or violates any copyright or trademark or trade secret of another party, (b) infringes any intellectual property right or the privacy or publicity rights of another, (c) is libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, harassing, hateful, offensive or otherwise violates any law or right of any third party, (d) contains a virus, trojan horse, worm, or other computer programming routine or engine intended to detrimentally interfere with any system, data or information, or (e) causes damage to the systems of Axtrion or its customers in any way.</p>
<h3>2.2</h3>
<p>If you disclose Customer Data which includes personally identifiable information (&ldquo;PII&rdquo;) of end users of your site or application (&ldquo;Customer Site&rdquo;) to Axtrion, you represent and warrant that: (i) you comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection, use and disclosure of PII on your Customer Site; (ii) you have posted and maintain a privacy policy on your Customer Site, which clearly and conspicuously discloses that: (a) you use third-party service providers to provide services to you in connection with your operation of your Customer Site, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors to such Customer Site; and (b) you may disclose end user PII to certain such third-party service providers in connection with their provision of services to you; and (iii) you have made all required notifications and obtained all required consents and authorizations from your end users relating to the disclosure of end user PII to a third party service provider like Axtrion. You further acknowledge and agree that your indemnity obligation under the &ldquo;Indemnity&rdquo; section below applies to your disclosure of end user PII under this Agreement.</p>
<h3>2.3</h3>
<p>Axtrion reserves the right to remove any Customer Data from the Site and the Services at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all. Axtrion may, but is not obligated to, monitor Customer Data and remove any content or prohibit any use of the Services, including by refusing to send email to your end users, if Axtrion believes in its sole discretion such content or use may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of these Terms of Service or any applicable laws or may impact delivery. All information transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the party from whom such information originated. Axtrion does not assume liability for any Customer Data. You are responsible for all Customer Data submitted under your account, including Customer Data contributed by a third party under your account.</p>
<h3>2.4</h3>
<p>Any feedback relating to the Services (&ldquo;Feedback&rdquo;) submitted to Axtrion shall become the property of Axtrion. Axtrion will not be required to treat any Feedback as confidential, and will not be liable for any ideas or incur any liability as a result of any similarities that may appear in our future Services, or operations.</p>
<h2>3. Third Party Sites and Services</h2>
<h3>3.1</h3>
<p>Users of Axtrion may gain access from the Services to third party sites on the Internet. Third party sites or services are not within the supervision or control of Axtrion. Axtrion makes no representations or warranties about any third party site or resource, and does not endorse the products or services offered by third parties. Axtrion disclaims all responsibility and liability for content on third party websites. You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against Axtrion with respect to third party content. Third party providers of ancillary services may require your agreement to additional or different license or other terms prior to your use or access of their sites or services. Any such agreement shall not in any way modify your Agreement here with Axtrion.</p>
<h2>4. Restrictions and Responsibilities</h2>
<h3>4.1</h3>
<p>This is an Agreement for the Services, and you are not granted a licence to any software under this Agreement (except to the extent required for you to use the Services). Except to the extent that applicable laws prevent Axtrion from doing so, you will not, directly or indirectly: reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of, or found at or through the Services or any software, documentation, or data related to the Services (&ldquo;Software&rdquo;); remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Services or any Software; reproduce or copy the Software or the Services or any part thereof; modify, translate, or create derivative works based on the Services or any Software; or copy, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the Services or any Software. The Services shall be used for your internal business (which includes civic or charitable) purposes only and you shall not use the Services or any Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the benefit of a third party. If you are using the Services in any country in the European Community or Australia, the prohibition against modifying, translating, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling or creating derivative works based on the Services or the Software does not affect your rights under any legislation implementing the E.C. Council Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs or the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).</p>
